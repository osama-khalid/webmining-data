They mark up and add notes. They negotiate consolidating drafts and which precedent and laws to cite or leave out, and whether the case should be ruled narrowly or broadly (does it apply to similar cases or not), and the phrases etc to use.\n\nSometimes one judge will have a pretty hard take, but their eventual conclusion for/against is the same as another judge who was much less harsh. Does the harsher or less harsh draft get the daylight? The conclusion is the same for the specific case, but the other variables like whether a law is struck down and whether or not this can apply to similar cases are really important questions to answer in the final version.\n\nAs the public, we only see the final version that will be the one that states the decision and reason(s) for it.\n\nIn this case, the draft went so far in its reach that it was controversial even with the justices who agreed Roe was poorly decided. But the draft was red meat to many of the public and politicians who spent 50 years trying to get the case overturned.\n\nBy leaking it early, two things of consequence happened.\n\n1- The justices could no longer negotiate the final decision without coming across as acting in bad faith, indecisive, or both; at least to the average Joe Public who might not be familiar with the process of consolidating multiple opinions into one.\n\n2- By revealing the extent to which Alito wanted to take the ruling, the \"turn Roe over\" crowd had ammunition to use against politicians and justices who might have otherwise been able to support a less agressive ruling, it would be similar to the phrase \"use their words against them\", but with pro-life people demanding further hardline action of the politicians they voted for. And pro-choice voters, of course, pointed out that this draft would open the door to reducing or reversing many other rights and services like equal access to a basic education, interracial marriage, same-sex marriage, gender-related medical care, and so on.\n\nIf the court had simply come out in June and said \"it's up to each state\" there would have been a lot of unrest, but nothing like what we've seen and will see. The draft went further and said that if the concern did not exist at the time the Constitution was written that laws could not be used to re-fit to meet a new problem or dilemma insociety. And that DOES open the door to something like interracial marriage which was only settled a few years apart from the Roe case. Both were major disputes that society had been aware of for centuries and were finally resolved under the same type of decision -- both boiled down to \"If it doesn't affect your neighbor, it's not their business\". Repealing Roe by claiming that older laws can not be applied to new rights means *both* those rulings are at risk.\n\nBy leaking the draft, the pro-life supporters were in a position to demand the elements of the draft be put into law by Congress if they did not come out in the final draft -- or to pressure Congress and the Court to try and keep those elements in the final draft. If we had not seen the draft, the court may well have been able to do as I mentioned above and release a final version simply saying \"it's up to each state\" and we could have avoided the mess we are now in.\n\nTLDR the leak was gasoline and billows on an already big fire.", "1673652982", "kmoonster", "/r/politics/comments/10b2zpk/supreme_court_closing_in_on_suspect_who_leaked/j48uuar/", "10b2zpk"], ["politics", "Who's house is that?

Hundreds of radicals were humiliated, beaten, or killed. In late 1920, the Blackshirt squads, often with the direct help of landowners, began to attack local government institutions and prevent left-wing administrations from taking power. Mussolini encouraged the squads\u2014although he soon tried to control them\u2014and organized similar raids in and around Milan. By late 1921, the Fascists controlled large parts of Italy, and the left, in part because of its failures during the postwar years, had all but collapsed. The government, dominated by middle-class Liberals, did little to combat this lawlessness, both through weak political will and a desire to see the mainly working-class left defeated. As the Fascist movement built a broad base of support around the powerful ideas of nationalism and anti-Bolshevism, Mussolini began planning to seize power at the national level.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the summer of 1922, Mussolini\u2019s opportunity presented itself. The remnants of the trade-union movement called a general strike. Mussolini declared that unless the government prevented the strike, the Fascists would. Fascist volunteers, in fact, helped to defeat the strike and thus advanced the Fascist claim to power.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Meanwhile, all over Italy the Fascists prepared for action, and the March on Rome began. Although it was far less orderly than Fascist propaganda later suggested, it was sufficiently threatening to bring down the government. And the king, prepared to accept the Fascist alternative, dispatched the telegram for which Mussolini had been waiting.\n\n[Hitler](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/hitler-comes-to-power):\n\n&gt;Beginning in fall 1929, there was a world economic crisis known as the Great Depression. Millions of Germans lost their jobs. Unemployment, hunger, poverty, and homelessness became serious problems in Germany in the early 1930s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The German government failed to solve the problems caused by the Great Depression. Germany was politically divided. This made passing new laws almost impossible because of disagreements in the German parliament. Many Germans lost faith in their leaders\u2019 ability to govern.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Radical political groups like the Nazi Party and the Communist Party became more prominent. They took advantage of the economic and political chaos. They used propaganda to attract Germans who were fed up with the political stalemate.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Nazis played on people\u2019s hopes, fears, and prejudices. They also offered scapegoats. They falsely claimed that Jews and Communists were to blame for Germany\u2019s problems. This claim was part of the Nazis\u2019 antisemitic and racist ideology.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In January 1933, Hitler did not immediately become a dictator. When he became chancellor, Germany\u2019s democratic constitution was still in effect. However, Hitler transformed Germany by manipulating the democratic political system. Hitler and other Nazi leaders used existing laws to destroy German democracy and create a dictatorship.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In August 1934, President Hindenburg died. Hitler proclaimed himself F\u00fchrer (leader) of Germany. From that point forward, Hitler was the dictator of Germany.\n\nThis is long enough already, but we can also tack on [Franco taking power after the Spanish Civil War](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Francisco-Franco)", "1670629033", "Konukaame", "/r/politics/comments/zgyw1w/clarence_thomas_might_have_just_broken_the_law_in/izlgkp4/", "zgyw1w"], ["politics", "Except she would get stomped if she ran as a republican primary so that play makes no sense.

It was something within The Doctor's character that transcended regeneration.  \n\nSo, Capaldi's self-reflection on the question of deep-down, \"Am I a good man\" is a natural one for the character to have at this time.  The rest of his arc is trying out several different answers to that question, usually ending in some sort of failure.  For example, one of the ideas he tries is good works, thinking a good man is simply doing good works.  It fails.

The writing was all there for a very dramatic, funny and deep story about a cancer victim that would be relevant not only to Marvel fans but also to people who are suffering with cancer, have family members with cancer or those who have lost people with cancer.\n\nHere you have history's forgotten woman, dumped and abandoned by her boyfriend and largely forgotten to the world.  In her desperation she turns to every possible way to treat her cancer.... and it fails, time after time.  And so where science failed she turned to magic (almost a line in the film!).  She grabs Thor's hammer and becomes Mighty Thor... the hammer sustains her and gives her a boost to survive.... while the treatment is also killing her very slowly.  Every time she uses it she gets closer to dying.  What a great plot device!  You could say that you could have a very deep film focusing mostly on Natalie Portman talking about a lasting legacy and what she hopes to leave the world after she dies.  A very real thing and worry for cancer victims... something families often don't get.\n\nParallel to that story you could have had the story of Gorr the God Butcher... brilliantly played (and wasted) with Christian Bale.  A religious man on a dying planet who has had his daughter taken from him while the gods just looked on and laughed.  He plots to steal all of the children of the gods (you know... the theme of legacy works here).\n\nThese are fantastic story archs, mostly well executed.  But there were a lot of small things that kept Oscar award winning performances from shining.  It was all of the Taiki Waititi bullshit to try and get laughs.  Like every single sad or serious moment would be broken up by a cheap laugh.  That's all the [flying goats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WZokPPn4-4) were... .they bridged serious moments with light heartedness.\n\nIt also didn't have to have Thor's story in it... at all.  That could have all basically been cut out and it could have focused completely around Mighty Thor and the deeper darker story of coming to terms with your own mortality and what you want to leave behind.\n\nI think in that film you can EDIT a really great movie.

I love this show enough to put up with the insane [four-hour block in the middle of the day live/linear scheduling **with** ads](https://tvline.com/lists/the-nevers-release-date-season-1-new-episodes-tubi/) (yes. It's worse than broadcast). Absolutely no shame to you if you have to wait for Roku Channel to get it.  At least the plotlines have streamlined a bit more so you don't have to watch an episode three times to figure out what's going on. :D  Man, I've missed this show and I'll watch it *any* way I can. They do not disappoint for me, and man it's moving fast. I'm going to be so sorry after tomorrow and there's no more.  I really kind of wish the US had gotten *Happy Valley S3* at the same time as the UK, because bopping from Tommy Lee Royce to Hugo Swan, James-Norton-wise, would've been *awesome* viewing whiplash.\n\nSmall tech notes: sometimes there's a dead space with a \"Hang On...\" message. I actually prefer this to getting the same ad three times on a loop, as other FAST services will do. YMMV. Also some guys in r/TheNevers are mentioning bandwidth issues. I use the ethernet port on my Roku Ultra with my cable modem and didn't see any such issues. But again, YMMV.\n\nSpeaking of Mutant Enemy stuff... ***Fantasy Island*** (Fox), being showrun by Craft &amp; Fain (who, iirc got their start on *Angel*), have occasionally roped in other Mutant Enemy alums, like Jane Espenson and Ben Edlund, to write for them. This week it was Drew Z. Greenberg, and it was great. One of my fuzzy-feel-good shows. Very much a revival made with love (though with a feminine middle-aged bent), rather than a graffitti'd-over drastic-change/warped reboot.  Like, say, the '90s reboot or the horror movie. I note with amusement Tubi has both the OG *Fantasy Island* and the '90s reboot with Malcolm McDowell's black-suited Roark.\n\n***Three Pines*** (Amazon Prime). Missed this when it dropped back in December, but I just needed a simple crime drama to binge, and being a Canadian show set in Quebec, and having Alfred Molina in the central role was enough to grab me. Solid 7 out of 10. Not necessarily a go-out-of-your-way show (like a *Happy Valley),* but decent if you need to scratch the genre itch.\n\n***The Way Home*** (Hallmark Channel). Yeah. Middle-aged lady, remember? :)  I'm having fun watching Canadian shows (I'm impatient for *Transplant* to return to NBC as well), and it's nice to see Chyler Leigh have a starring role after Alex on *Supergirl.* And one of the showrunners is Heather Conkie who was my favorite writer on *\\[Road to\\] Avonlea*. It started out as a YA time-travel adventure, but the magical pond that bridges the past and present has now been traveled by mom (the Chyler Leigh character) as well as the teen protagonist, so it's not a strict teen YA show. Still wholesome family Canadian entertainment, tho. :D\n\nYes, I'm watching TLoU and loving it, but you've already read a million comments about that. :)  And there's nothing I can say about my network/cable shows (*9-1-1: Lone Star, CSI: Vegas, The Flash*, *Mayfair Witches* etc.) that'd be more than \"okay, holding steady\". :)  Except I think the only reason I'm still watching *The Flash* is the comic book collector's completist urge and the fact that there's only 13 episodes this final season. \\[grin\\].\n\nMy list of upcoming stuff (service announcement: this sub maintains a similar YT-trailer-linked list in the About tab for the sub):\n\n* 2/17.

The estate has its gripes with Jackson\u2019s adaptations (the late Christopher Tolkien, the author\u2019s son, said they \u201ceviscerated\u201d the books) but wasn\u2019t interested in treading the same ground. Netflix pitched doing several shows, such as a Gandalf series and an Aragorn drama. \u201cThey took the Marvel approach,\u201d said one insider to the talks, \u201cand that completely freaked out the estate.\u201d\n\n&gt;Amazon\u2019s negotiating team (led by Sharon Tal Yguado, Roy Price and Dan Scharf) wooed the estate not with a specific pitch, but with a pledge of a close relationship that would give the estate a creative seat at the table so it could protect Tolkien\u2019s legacy. There was also, of course, the money. Sources say the staggering number that\u2019s been widely reported ($250 million) was actually Netflix\u2019s bid and that Amazon\u2019s number was tens of millions less (albeit, still staggering).\n\nFrom [this article](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-rings-of-power-showrunners-interview-season-2-1235233124/).", "1666222513", "doegred", "/r/television/comments/y81cvs/the_lord_of_the_rings_ip_broker_says_franchise/it056a1/", "y81cvs"], ["television", "She's one note", "1666222500", "fvalt05", "/r/television/comments/y8crnr/the_morning_show_season_3_casts_natalie_morales/it055bm/", "y8crnr"], ["television", "I love me some seraph fightscenes.", "1666222462", "penatbater", "/r/television/comments/y82c6u/cyberpunk_edgerunners_producer_says_there_are_no/it052c9/", "y82c6u"], ["television", "Get syncler my Friend, everything one in one.
