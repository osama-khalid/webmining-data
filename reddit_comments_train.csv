politics,"Hi, I am one of the hated family medicine PAs in this thread.

I diagnose pneumonia, DVTs, PEs, cancers regularly (20 cancer diagnoses in my first year not counting bcc /scc, which was more than my entire clinic combined).  I remember being baffled that a physician didn't consider MS in one of my first patients in what I thought was a really obvious case. As a student I helped my attending reconsider a female patient with abdominal pain as a MI, and a patient he semi blew OFF as a drunk as a CVA. He is a good er doc, he just missed the first and let his biases get him on the second. 

I have no reason to think I'm better than any other PA or NP; these are just frankly common things that are easy to manage from a PCP perspective. I am mid career at this point, and I don't have reason to doubt my capabilities, and I know precisely what my limitations are. 

More challenging diagnoses would be things like myesthenia gravis or rheumatological illnesses that don't neatly fit the standard lab panels for things like lupus or sjogrens. Even if it is obvious, they're still getting referred out because that's not my scope of practice. 

It's perfectly fine for people to ask to only see MDs. I appreciate that they're up front with what they want, but their expectations are somewhat silly compared to the reality of medicine. 

From my perspective, it's annoying to see reimbursement at 85 percent for a visit with me, work more than the physicians do in one week combined, and then not really get compensated great compared to PAs in specialties. 

I've been considering starting up my own clinic over the last two years, as it's really the only way for me to advance at this point. I don't know that I will, but it would be nice to be able to afford a single family home in my neighborhood.",1675640168,Awildgarebear,/r/politics/comments/10ub1tm/doctors_arent_burned_out_from_overwork_were/j7ddzlu/,10ub1tm

I'm pretty sure you're wrong on this interpretation.  Page 4 is for crime gun recovery sourced from the state - ie the gun was bought in CA, then recovered at a crime scene anywhere in the US.  We can see this by cross-referencing numbers found in other reports.

https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/report/nevada-state-report/download

https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/report/oregon-state-report/download

Take a look at page 4 in those reports - not only does the CA number on page 4 match the number associated with that state on page 3 of the CA report, page 4 for both AZ and NV lists California cities as top recovery cities.  If page 4 was exclusively for in-state recoveries, we wouldn't see CA cities listed on the page 4 for other states.

&gt; Like the entire point of the individual state reports is to determine what is accounting for their crime guns.

The Government Accountability Office, an independent agency of Congress, said in its preliminary report that Chertoff had failed to move quickly to mobilize resources despite advance warnings that Katrina was likely to be a devastating storm. And, the report said, Chertoff’s failure to name an individual to spearhead the response was a prime factor in the delays and confusion that followed.”",1674862589,BelAirGhetto,/r/politics/comments/10mwzqd/progressives_blast_supreme_court_over_secret/j662heu/,10mwzqd

&gt;You said, ""Voting on the debt ceiling is ridiculous. It should increase automatically when spending is authorized."" So you think there should be no restrictions on spending and we can just continue to run up the debt?

You're missing my whole point. They *already* agreed to spend the money *when they approved the budget*. Raising the debt ceiling has no effect on spending. The spending was already done. That's why it's stupid to make the debt ceiling a separate vote. It's a made up thing that only exists bc some congressmen got freaked out when they saw what we were spending during World War I.

&gt;Sure, but since the FBI did not say that any ""purposeful deletion"" (whatever that means) happened, it's really irrelevant.

This explains a lot, here, ill help.
&gt;Purposeful:  having or showing determination or resolve.
&gt;""purposeful activities"", intentional.

&gt;delete: verb remove or obliterate

It is not opinion, it is referenced several times, one implying that its likely there was intent, just not provable.  The intent at the end of the sorting activity was to delete the emails.  
They sorted , by key word,work related from personal,  submitted  the work related ones and deleted the rest.

&gt;...and that are now gone because they deleted all e-mails they did not return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their devices in such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery.
&gt;for each email in folder.

politics,"After a case is heard, the justices each draft their own take, and pass the drafts back and forth to each other. They mark up and add notes. They negotiate consolidating drafts and which precedent and laws to cite or leave out, and whether the case should be ruled narrowly or broadly (does it apply to similar cases or not), and the phrases etc to use.

Sometimes one judge will have a pretty hard take, but their eventual conclusion for/against is the same as another judge who was much less harsh. Does the harsher or less harsh draft get the daylight? The conclusion is the same for the specific case, but the other variables like whether a law is struck down and whether or not this can apply to similar cases are really important questions to answer in the final version.

As the public, we only see the final version that will be the one that states the decision and reason(s) for it.

In this case, the draft went so far in its reach that it was controversial even with the justices who agreed Roe was poorly decided. But the draft was red meat to many of the public and politicians who spent 50 years trying to get the case overturned.

By leaking it early, two things of consequence happened.

1- The justices could no longer negotiate the final decision without coming across as acting in bad faith, indecisive, or both; at least to the average Joe Public who might not be familiar with the process of consolidating multiple opinions into one.

2- By revealing the extent to which Alito wanted to take the ruling, the ""turn Roe over"" crowd had ammunition to use against politicians and justices who might have otherwise been able to support a less agressive ruling, it would be similar to the phrase ""use their words against them"", but with pro-life people demanding further hardline action of the politicians they voted for. And pro-choice voters, of course, pointed out that this draft would open the door to reducing or reversing many other rights and services like equal access to a basic education, interracial marriage, same-sex marriage, gender-related medical care, and so on.

If the court had simply come out in June and said ""it's up to each state"" there would have been a lot of unrest, but nothing like what we've seen and will see. The draft went further and said that if the concern did not exist at the time the Constitution was written that laws could not be used to re-fit to meet a new problem or dilemma insociety. And that DOES open the door to something like interracial marriage which was only settled a few years apart from the Roe case. Both were major disputes that society had been aware of for centuries and were finally resolved under the same type of decision -- both boiled down to ""If it doesn't affect your neighbor, it's not their business"". Repealing Roe by claiming that older laws can not be applied to new rights means *both* those rulings are at risk.

By leaking the draft, the pro-life supporters were in a position to demand the elements of the draft be put into law by Congress if they did not come out in the final draft -- or to pressure Congress and the Court to try and keep those elements in the final draft. If we had not seen the draft, the court may well have been able to do as I mentioned above and release a final version simply saying ""it's up to each state"" and we could have avoided the mess we are now in.

TLDR the leak was gasoline and billows on an already big fire.",1673652982,kmoonster,/r/politics/comments/10b2zpk/supreme_court_closing_in_on_suspect_who_leaked/j48uuar/,10b2zpk

politics,"1st, it doesn't.  These kinds of bills aren't meant to protect anyone.  They are meant to make living publicly as a trans person harder if not impossible.  I'm not going to explain why here.  There are plenty of other people who have talked at length about it, including me in other comments elsewhere.  (The secret to understanding trans issues and why this point might not be obvious is that trans people don't usually get a voice on trans issues in the public discourse outside of inconsequential spaces like this, which should tell you a lot already.). This ""solution"" does absolutely nothing for trans people while also putting a big target on their back.  It's a ""solution"" for cis people, not for trans people.

2nd, it's obviously, childishly impractical.  Most buildings can't just accommodate a new bathroom being added after the fact.  So that's just off the table.  And if you think just adding a specialized trans or non-binary stall to existing bathrooms like how handicap stalls exist, you don't understand the issue.  The stall isn't where the problem comes from and, once again, puts a target on trans people's backs while not actually solving anything.  It's a ""solution"" so cis people don't have to think about or understand the root of the issue.

3rd, it doesn't solve discrimination.  It *is* discrimination.  Do you not understand why ""separate but equal"" facilities were a bad thing?  Because this is the exact same thing.

This isn't anything new for the fringe left in the west, in the 1970s they teamed up with the fossil fuel industry to stop nuclear plants from being built. Today they block solar and wind farms from being built. Making sure these projects get tied up in permitting hell indefinitely is just their latest tactic. They're universally anti-development and they sell it to the public by labeling it environmentalism. 

And this isn't an opinion, permitting reform would be objectively good for the environment.

A recession is the fastest way to make greedy companies stop their artificial inflation due to less sales.

A recession is the best way to get the average American putting money into savings instead of blowing it on various crap.

A recession is excellent for company efficiency because workers will do their best to avoid the pink slips by becoming as productive/essential as possible.

A recession could help lower over-valued securities and help prevent a bubble-popping Wall Street meltdown.

Recessions also generally force some companies to innovate and compete more fiercely to retain clients/sales, thereby helping keep costs down for consumers.

Recession also generally brings the price of the dollar lower which allows for greater exports and more American tourism.",1670888203,EwingsRevenge21,/r/politics/comments/zjnm09/dollar_rises_as_inflation_pressures_persist_fomc/izzembx/,zjnm09

WHEN are they going to die out in enough numbers to make a difference? And even though young voters care about those things doesn't mean they weren't brought up in Republican households. they will still vote repugnican no matter what.

Whether or not passing this was a good idea I have no comment on as there's way more nuance to it due to not every tax being a good thing. Thankfully your fellow ""idiot"" Arizonans also passed prop 129 which limits the subject of a citizen initiated ballot initiatives to only 1 subject therefor voiding any tax that's snuck into it if it's not stated in the title. This is also already the case with non citizen initiated ballots due to prop 206. They also rejected prop 128 to disallow lawmakers from trying to amend voter approved ballot initiatives just because the AZ joke of a Supreme Court tries to say it's illegal (which could clearly be abused for any initiatives they simply didn't agree with).

April 1991: Congress signed a joint resolution ending a national railroad strike less than 24 hours after it began. President George H.W. Bush signed the legislation that imposed recommendations made by a Presidential emergency board if the issues were not resolved within 65 days.

May 1971: About 570,000 railroad workers went on strike for three days before Congress intervened and imposed pay increases.

July 1967: The two-day strike, which resulted from a dispute over wages, was ended after President Lyndon Johnson signed legislation allowing the Attorney General to obtain an injunction ordering 459,000 rail workers to return to their jobs.

politics,"Okay technically — but way worse. They’ve always actively avoided missionary work in black areas where they can (same classic “unsafe neighborhoods” bs that other groups do), but before the 70’s, black members were technically allowed *but banned from Temples, certain leadership positions, and doctrinally the highest tier of heaven.* 

This only changed in the 70’s when the church faced extreme scrutiny over their segregation, and their tax-exempt status and BYU’s legitimacy were called into question (just like God magically changing his mind on polygamy to let Utah become a state).

Being banned from the temple, doctrinally they were locked in to a lower tier of heaven as “handmaids and servants to the elect,” or the white members who got to the jackpot-tier in heaven. The temple is also where the big culty rituals and blessings happen, so segregating them along a “not one drop” line is disgusting if you believe all the temple stuff is real.

The church’s history on racism is absolutely comparable to their institutional homophobia and misogyny. Brigham Young was a vile racist who loved slavery and advocated for Iran-style religious honor killings (the “blood atonement”) over INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE, and used his position as prophet to declare it God’s law. 

Young is also the source of the claim that they’re descended from Cain himself and bear the curse, not just a handful of racist member spreading “false doctrine” as progressive members claim today. He spread the idea that in the mythical War in Heaven (the conflict where Satan rebelled against Jesus and God in Mormon theology), black people were apparently “fence-sitters” who didn’t choose a side and are cursed to face racist abuse as a consequence — note the justification for systemic AND individual bigotry, as well as enshrining it as a divine fixture in society.

Long Island is notoriously racist, classist, and against any sort of change that would actually help anyone on the basis of ""I don't want you to get help! Only for me.""   


Long Island is where I live, so I'm going to stick with it. A lot of the Democratic candidates this year were not great. Melanie D'Arrigo was seemingly the best one, and she lost in the primary because she was ""too left"" for the red of Long Island. Long Islanders are also all about guns and the 2nd Amendment but they're *also* heavily pro-police. Red candidates here have *huge* connections to both SCPD and NCPD, which isn't surprising, but it still feels like I should point it out. There are so many police that endorse candidates and have them run on ""Stop Crime"" promises despite Nassau and Suffolk being 2 of the safest counties in America.

It furthers the conversation by supplementing what you said.

One connects to the other by showing that our dependence on oil becomes our obsession and can (and will) be our undoing.

We watch them rise and fall.

We are in a period of old power falling and new power rising. 

Biden is a disjunctive president because of choices made and maga has its own ideas about national, regional and global governance. Maga also has global allies and are riding a long and creeping rightward course correction. 

Most of us moderates voted for Biden for varying reason but overall the dude/team are fucking up and creating acceleration when the point of his winning was to slow-walk things instead by bringing back bipartisan civility so we could have an easier transition phase and transfer of power. The rate we are going now is likely to hand maga much more power comparative with FDR/New Dealers or worse give them a blank slate by going scorched earth.

I personally think that that phenomenon is fascinating. Look into Aimee Semple McPherson. The whole thing of mashing old-timey tent revivals with ( then ) cutting edge comms tech ( radio ) seems inherently interesting to me, but I like historical things about media. 

If you ever heard of Levon Helm from ""The Band"", he's on a film talking about how that entire sort of music came from medicine shows, which borrowed a lot from moveable tent revivals.  I find that intriguing. 

The whole show is rich with potential for biting satire of the whole hypocrisy-rich LA culture of the time. LAPD were pretty gosh-darn thuggish. The whole ""zoot suit riot"" thing is quite the story.

Each weird thing had a symbolic point and it came together at the end in a very sobering way.

As for Patti, it is ironic. The whole point is that it DOES happen in real life, the hypocrisy in some religions is what brings many to their downfall of many sins. Patti was not STRONGLY possessed and that was another point. She ALLOWED herself to be taken and didn't even put up a LITTLE fight to be shaken from him.

television,"I think the themes of Capaldi's run kinda begin at the 50th anniversary special.  

Obviously, they didn't destroy Galifrey, so as the audience we think ""Doctor saved Galifrey.  Doctor good,"" but it's not so simple.  3 different versions of the Doctor were willing to do it, and were only stopped from doing so by Clara reminding him to ""Be a Doctor.""  The willingness to destroy Galifrey wasn't something that afterwards that could be blamed on a rogue regeneration of the Doctor.  It was something within The Doctor's character that transcended regeneration.  

So, Capaldi's self-reflection on the question of deep-down, ""Am I a good man"" is a natural one for the character to have at this time.  The rest of his arc is trying out several different answers to that question, usually ending in some sort of failure.  For example, one of the ideas he tries is good works, thinking a good man is simply doing good works.  It fails.  Finally the Doctor comes to the conclusion of his arc and what makes a good man in his [standoff with the two Masters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnouj9Yz-Gs).  

Then, in his last speech, he sums up everything he's learned and what it means to be The Doctor.  ""[Never be cruel.  Never be cowardly](https://youtu.be/yJqsPBWbtjk?t=61).  Notice how that's a direct callback to the 50th when Clara asks ""[You told me the name you chose was a promise.  What was the promise?](https://youtu.be/gPu9XtfEicM?t=141)""

""Never be cruel.  Never be cowardly.  Always try to be nice, but never fail to be kind.  Just kind.

That's what makes a good man, and that's who the Doctor is.  Just kind.",1676935952,Quexana,/r/television/comments/117lzei/why_did_the_doctor_choose_his_face_the_girl_who/j9cqjnn/,117lzei

television,"&gt; As someone who got through the heist and still wasn't invested. What an I missing that seemingly everyone else finds phenomenal?

I think Andor is a great show but I *still* think I'm missing something that other people love about it. It's almost like I respect its quality, rather than because it resonates with me a lot or tugs at my emotions. Not that the characters are bad (Dedra Meero is great in particular) but the show's main strengths are elsewhere.

For me, its strength is its tension. It's really good at building things up, slowly tightening the noose before big events happen. It happens during all the big ""arcs"" of the show. I also love the worldbuilding; it's a show about life under an oppressive regime more than it is about Cassian Andor.

She was an undercover and she was like really good at her job and one of the only highly competent people on the show and then she gets “caught” in one of the dumbest ways possible. THEN they had essentially flipped one of the bad guys and he willingly supplies Gina’s killer with a gun and doesn’t warn her or the cops of the plan to kill Gina and then he lets Gina get killed and buried her body in a shallow grave.

They had left it as a cliffhanger and everyone thought she was going to live, that it was staged.

television,"I mean, it's not all the writing, it feels like it's mostly the editing.

Thor Love and Thunder was, particularly bad.  The writing was all there for a very dramatic, funny and deep story about a cancer victim that would be relevant not only to Marvel fans but also to people who are suffering with cancer, have family members with cancer or those who have lost people with cancer.

Here you have history's forgotten woman, dumped and abandoned by her boyfriend and largely forgotten to the world.  In her desperation she turns to every possible way to treat her cancer.... and it fails, time after time.  And so where science failed she turned to magic (almost a line in the film!).  She grabs Thor's hammer and becomes Mighty Thor... the hammer sustains her and gives her a boost to survive.... while the treatment is also killing her very slowly.  Every time she uses it she gets closer to dying.  What a great plot device!  You could say that you could have a very deep film focusing mostly on Natalie Portman talking about a lasting legacy and what she hopes to leave the world after she dies.  A very real thing and worry for cancer victims... something families often don't get.

Parallel to that story you could have had the story of Gorr the God Butcher... brilliantly played (and wasted) with Christian Bale.  A religious man on a dying planet who has had his daughter taken from him while the gods just looked on and laughed.  He plots to steal all of the children of the gods (you know... the theme of legacy works here).

These are fantastic story archs, mostly well executed.  But there were a lot of small things that kept Oscar award winning performances from shining.  It was all of the Taiki Waititi bullshit to try and get laughs.  Like every single sad or serious moment would be broken up by a cheap laugh.  That's all the [flying goats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WZokPPn4-4) were... .they bridged serious moments with light heartedness.

It also didn't have to have Thor's story in it... at all.  That could have all basically been cut out and it could have focused completely around Mighty Thor and the deeper darker story of coming to terms with your own mortality and what you want to leave behind.

I think in that film you can EDIT a really great movie.  I think a lot of the ""writing issues"" were director edits.",1676590309,garlicroastedpotato,/r/television/comments/11401xc/how_much_is_too_much_marvel_and_star_wars_disney/j8u5a8f/,11401xc

television,"***The Nevers S1B*** (Tubi on linear WB TV Watchlist channel \[headdesk\]). I love this show enough to put up with the insane [four-hour block in the middle of the day live/linear scheduling **with** ads](https://tvline.com/lists/the-nevers-release-date-season-1-new-episodes-tubi/) (yes. It's worse than broadcast). Absolutely no shame to you if you have to wait for Roku Channel to get it.  At least the plotlines have streamlined a bit more so you don't have to watch an episode three times to figure out what's going on. :D  Man, I've missed this show and I'll watch it *any* way I can. They do not disappoint for me, and man it's moving fast. I'm going to be so sorry after tomorrow and there's no more.  I really kind of wish the US had gotten *Happy Valley S3* at the same time as the UK, because bopping from Tommy Lee Royce to Hugo Swan, James-Norton-wise, would've been *awesome* viewing whiplash.

Small tech notes: sometimes there's a dead space with a ""Hang On..."" message. I actually prefer this to getting the same ad three times on a loop, as other FAST services will do. YMMV. Also some guys in r/TheNevers are mentioning bandwidth issues. I use the ethernet port on my Roku Ultra with my cable modem and didn't see any such issues. But again, YMMV.

Speaking of Mutant Enemy stuff... ***Fantasy Island*** (Fox), being showrun by Craft &amp; Fain (who, iirc got their start on *Angel*), have occasionally roped in other Mutant Enemy alums, like Jane Espenson and Ben Edlund, to write for them. This week it was Drew Z. Greenberg, and it was great. One of my fuzzy-feel-good shows. Very much a revival made with love (though with a feminine middle-aged bent), rather than a graffitti'd-over drastic-change/warped reboot.  Like, say, the '90s reboot or the horror movie. I note with amusement Tubi has both the OG *Fantasy Island* and the '90s reboot with Malcolm McDowell's black-suited Roark.

***Three Pines*** (Amazon Prime). Missed this when it dropped back in December, but I just needed a simple crime drama to binge, and being a Canadian show set in Quebec, and having Alfred Molina in the central role was enough to grab me. Solid 7 out of 10. Not necessarily a go-out-of-your-way show (like a *Happy Valley),* but decent if you need to scratch the genre itch.

***The Way Home*** (Hallmark Channel). Yeah. Middle-aged lady, remember? :)  I'm having fun watching Canadian shows (I'm impatient for *Transplant* to return to NBC as well), and it's nice to see Chyler Leigh have a starring role after Alex on *Supergirl.* And one of the showrunners is Heather Conkie who was my favorite writer on *\[Road to\] Avonlea*. It started out as a YA time-travel adventure, but the magical pond that bridges the past and present has now been traveled by mom (the Chyler Leigh character) as well as the teen protagonist, so it's not a strict teen YA show. Still wholesome family Canadian entertainment, tho. :D

Yes, I'm watching TLoU and loving it, but you've already read a million comments about that. :)  And there's nothing I can say about my network/cable shows (*9-1-1: Lone Star, CSI: Vegas, The Flash*, *Mayfair Witches* etc.) that'd be more than ""okay, holding steady"". :)  Except I think the only reason I'm still watching *The Flash* is the comic book collector's completist urge and the fact that there's only 13 episodes this final season. \[grin\].

He’s basically on a public tour discussing his insobriety and how he’s changed. I personally find his a little disingenuous, because last time I saw him on a podcast he kept saying he was sorry and that he changed, but when it came to the actual abuse, he kept saying “well, some of it was true, I don’t even want to get into it…” implying his innocence without setting the record straight.

Still, I think even Shia has a better chance at a comeback because again, he’s just more talented at his craft.

television,"Yeah, I totally agree on that. I've never felt being 100% faithful to the source material should even be a priority at all, let alone the top priority. The mediums are different (usually books to film/tv but in this case game to tv), and writers should adapt to the new medium. GOT is kind of an exception but not because deviating from the source was bad, they just executed it poorly. People are still all upset about Tom Bombadil being cut out of the LOTR movies. With the Harry Potter movies, the first couple of movies were slavishly accurate to the book, and ended up being pretty mediocre as a result (still good movies IMO because of the novelty, but you could just see the pages being turned watching ""and then this happened, and then this happened...""). It wasn't until Prisoner of Azkaban where a director injected some style and changed some things around where it got elevated. Blade Runner is actually a vast improvement on its book form, so are The Shining and Jurassic Park because they changed it to suit the requirements.

television,"&gt;You are quite presumptuous, lol.
&gt;

I'm only working with your own comments.

&gt;is somehow me forcing my toddler to view explicit material?
&gt;

I never said that you showed your toddler anything. Weird place for your mind to go, but not unexpected. Almost like you recognize that what you did was wrong, so you're desperately trying to rationalize your objectively weird behavior. Go ask your friends what's weirder: seeing tits at a Hugh Hefner party or you looking up topless videos next to your kids.

I do love this reaction, though. 

&gt;It is quite amazing how you can so confidently act as the judge of morality. 

Well morality is both individual and cultural. As an individual, I choose not to conflate events happening at a Hugh Hefner party to someone pulling out their dick at work. In the eyes of our justice system, the two events are very different. So yea, pretty confident. You know what, instead of your friends, go ask your parents and in-laws which is weirder.

&gt;That is what always cracks me up about Reddit culture. You will jump on anyone that is deemed immoral or problematic 
&gt;

I'm sure you can point to examples of me doing this, right? Ooo someone disagreed with me, they must be calling me problematic. You need to assume that I'm doing this so you can get out of actually engaging with my points. It's a cope out bordering on persecution complex.

&gt;Meanwhile, in the next breath

Seeing as the comment about your children came last, this is quite impossible.

&gt;you are comparing an entire room of clothed models to “strippers,” 

No idea what you even mean here. Strippers are not fully clothed and burlesque shows often feature, of not nudity, then at least sexual content.

&gt;made up standards for the reasonable expectation of nudity (I’m still unclear on the threshold for this one, please explain further, lol)
&gt;

Well I gave several examples. I also didn't make them up. They're literally different from a legal standpoint. But here's some more stuff you'll ignore:

If we go to a strip club, there's a reasonable expectation to see breasts. Those strippers aren't seen (other than by the puritanical) to be doing anything illegal or immoral. But if a guy pulls out his dick in the same strip club, it's can suddenly be seen as both. Why is that? Oh yea, because different environments have different standards of consent involving adults engaging in adult behavior.

If you attend an adult drag event, you're consenting to seeing racy material, some even bordering on pornographic. But if you attend a drag queen story hour, you're only consenting to having a book read. Shared element, but wildly different expectations.

&gt;You keep referring to this as a “Playboy party,” when it is very clearly a birthday party, and also had friends and family members in attendance. 
&gt;

Yes, the birthday party for a porn mogul. He typically has multiple parties, one of which is usually held as an invite only at a private suite like this. His family regularly attends his Playboy mansion parties. 

You're just splitting hairs.

&gt;You are jumping through all of these hoops 

""All those hoops"" being explaining the difference between a professional environment and the private party of a man known for having orgies at his parties.

&gt;Why is that? Why are you so determined to prove that one is ok, and the other is not? What is your underlying motivation?

My underlying motivation is to prevent weirdos like you from conflating systemic rape (curious as to what your motivation for that was) and genuine sexual harassment that easily constitutes a hostile work environment, to seeing a topless woman at the private, invite only party of a porn mogul. Why are you so dead set on downplaying hostile work environments?",1674603241,PatrickBearman,/r/television/comments/10izc6g/pamela_anderson_alleges_tim_allen_flashed_his/j5r29rm/,10izc6g

The commentary was odd because I had never seen a show where during the commercial break someone would talk about the episode. 

It was an older guy talking about gun violence as it related to the Simpsons and how in America we were becoming desensitized to it and that was going to be an issue that only gets worse.

Not saying it’s not slower - it is slower because pre-production and post-production on modern TV shows is far more time-consuming than it used to be (higher expectations of quality etc), and scheduling of casts is frequently complex as most people aren’t exclusively signed to a project, and work on other things across a year, so scheduling is a difficult beast to manage - again particularly in the past year, when schedules are still dealing with fitting in projects that were cancelled during 2020-2021.

Not only that but i do think it's to make the general population standards be reduced as time goes on, so that production of movies and series becomes a lot less riskier because ""people are going to like anyway"".

Right. So how about just murdering America Chavez instead. That’s great character growth right there. 

&gt;U also say it was crap motivation to have one of the most dark and corrupting relics in marvel corrupt someone who’s had issues with their own moral compass since their debut in Avenger AOU. 

Trying to use AoU to prove the point is counterintuitive considering the fact that it was her first of six appearances and they’re trying to go backwards with her? Why should how she was in that movie matter if they don’t develop her beyond that? Furthermore, the darkhold is not some famous relic in the MCU, its only setup was with Agatha and Wanda should know better after dealing with her.

Drones simply can't compete with helicopters because drones need to be transported by a ground unit. Helicopters get to the scene much faster without getting stuck in traffic. They can quickly hop between multiple towns and stories without landing. And the chopper can typically stay over the scene much longer than a drone. All of those are extremely advantageous if, just to pick a random example, the story is ""*ground vehicles are stuck in traffic*"". Or because there aren't roads near the location. Or it's over the water. Or the roads are barricaded. Or it's in a city where you don't want to launch a drone around buildings.

Maybe you don't think those advantages are worth the risk of using a manned vehicle, but that's a totally different argument than ""it's just because marketing.""",1669246503,restrictednumber,/r/television/comments/z2w5oy/cbs_news_helicopter_crashes_in_north_carolina/ixjseb6/,z2w5oy

I'm not going to say Graceland is bad--because it's not. Compared to other somewhat similar cable shows, it's not as good at any of those things.

If you take all the fun out of Monk and Psych, you've still got a murder mystery show, but not one that fits with cable shows like White Collar, Eureka, Warehouse 13, The Librarians, and Leverage. Even reaching for Suits, Franklin &amp; Bash, and drama-focused dramedies, Graceland didn't feel like it really fit in with that crop. You can shut your brain off and have a nice time for 45 minutes with those shows. 

To me, it felt more in line with Burn Notice and Covert Affairs where the humor and fun are replaced with action and suspense. Graceland just doesn't have much in the way of memorable or likeable characters. It's been years and I didn't finish S1; S2 didn't look like an improvement, so I could be wrong about where it went and what it is...

...but I trust the general consensus that this was just meh.

Here's the thing. Stories are formulaic. That's not a bad thing! Especially in more recent storytelling. Twists, subversions, and that sense of unexpectedness has always been the standard though. Look at something like TVTropes to see just how common any given plot point turns to another.

And I don't care how clever you are. If you have an audience that's speculating, particularly when they're speculating and theorycrafting in a group, which is like, the ENTIRE GIMMICK of watercooler TV, well, a thousand writers in a room are eventually going to write your story, and once they have the beginning of the plot they're going to be able to write several reasonably accurate versions of the story you wrote.

TARUSA has been like this for a while. They do have some cool and challenging tasks sometimes, but in general the episode formula is a lot more simple than TARCAN.

Typically TARUSA is just Pit Start -&gt; Roadblock/Detour -&gt; Roadblock/Detour -&gt; Pit Stop with the *occasional* Route Info. Even when they do have a Route Info, it is more often than not simply a ""go to this location to get your next clue"".

Compare this to TARCAN where the episode formula usually includes several Route Info *tasks*. Sometimes Route Info tasks in TARCAN can take even longer and be more challenging than the RB/Detours.

It also delves into right-wing politics a lot. I've read all the major High Republic stories thus far; no small part of HR criticism is those upset over the diversity in the cast.

But the loudest group of ""anti-Disney SW"" people online are not people I'd ever want to be associated with.

television,"&gt;Sources say HBO pitched the estate on retelling Middle-earth’s “Third Age” — essentially remaking Peter Jackson’s beloved Lord of the Rings trilogy, which grossed $3 billion and won 17 Oscars. The estate has its gripes with Jackson’s adaptations (the late Christopher Tolkien, the author’s son, said they “eviscerated” the books) but wasn’t interested in treading the same ground. Netflix pitched doing several shows, such as a Gandalf series and an Aragorn drama. “They took the Marvel approach,” said one insider to the talks, “and that completely freaked out the estate.”

&gt;Amazon’s negotiating team (led by Sharon Tal Yguado, Roy Price and Dan Scharf) wooed the estate not with a specific pitch, but with a pledge of a close relationship that would give the estate a creative seat at the table so it could protect Tolkien’s legacy. There was also, of course, the money. Sources say the staggering number that’s been widely reported ($250 million) was actually Netflix’s bid and that Amazon’s number was tens of millions less (albeit, still staggering).

Hell even if you skipped most of the MCU films and just watched Infinity War, the first scene he beats Hulk without an issue establishing to even non comic readers wow this guy is strong. And then the moment is about his characterisation. 

Thanos is set up so well that you don't have to be a comic book reader.
