1
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,530
People will say l am a monster...

2
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,365
...for what I've done.

3
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,035
And maybe they're right.

4
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,539
l always thought that l'd have more...

5
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,833
-...time.
-Dad?

6
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,585
Dad!

7
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,836
l'm sorry.

8
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,714
Peter?

9
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,981
He likes to sleep with the light on
at night.

10
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,733
Mary, we have to go.

11
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,655
Dad.

12
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,117
Be good.

13
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,505
I found a safe place for us to spend
the night at Lake Geneva.

14
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,717
-Are you uploading it?
-To Roosevelt. All of it.

15
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,594
Just in case we....

16
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,098
We're gonna be fine, Mary.

17
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,767
Did you see his face?
He's never gonna understand.

18
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,644
Mary, we've been through this.

19
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,689
Our life as we know it is over.

20
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,484
We're gonna spend every day
from now on looking over our shoulders.

21
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,654
Never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

22
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,656
He's just a little boy.

23
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,741
I know, I know. But it's gonna be okay.

24
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,286
It's gonna be all right.

25
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,011
No rest for the weary, huh?

26
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,222
No, I'm afraid not.

27
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,516
Occupational hazard, I guess.

28
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,561
What is it you're working on?

29
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,317
Just planning ahead. Do you think
I could speak with the pilot?

30
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,445
Something you need?

31
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,739
Perhaps l can help.

32
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,365
I'd just like to radio ahead...

33
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,034
...and make sure everything's in order
for when we land.

34
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,790
I think we both know
that's not an option, Dr. Parker.

35
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,767
-Richard.
-They say you're a genius.

36
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:28,851
Richard!

37
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,520
Not if you thought you could escape.

38
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,354
Richard!

39
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:50,414
Mary!

40
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,551
Mare.

41
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,137
It's okay. lt's okay. That's okay.
It's okay.

42
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,557
I got you. l have you, okay? Okay?

43
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,184
Just gonna make you safe.

44
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,895
It's done. lt's done.
Can you breathe? Mare?

45
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,773
-Roosevelt.
-What?

46
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,107
Roosevelt.

47
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,536
It's back up. lt's back up.

48
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,288
It's back up, okay? Hey, hey, hey.

49
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,749
We're gonna be all right, okay?
You stay with me.

50
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,256
What do you got for me today,
New York?

51
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,300
Reporting live
from New York 1 chopper.

52
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,887
An Oscorp truck carrying plutonium
has been hijacked.

53
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,931
A police chase is in progress.

54
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,557
All right. Let's get to work.

55
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,773
Say hello to Aleksei Sytsevich!

56
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,179
Spider-Man!

57
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,973
Hello, pedestrians.

58
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,826
Knock, knock.

59
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,828
Mr. Criminal?

60
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,329
Hey, my name is Spider-Man.

61
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,457
You can call me Web-Head,
you can call me Amazing...

62
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,709
...just don't call me late for dinner.
You get it?

63
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,713
Not a shaker? Are you a hugger?

64
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,382
-I am killer!
-Whoa, okay.

65
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,510
Warning. Plutonium-238
is a radioactive material...

66
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,345
...and is highly explosive.

67
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,181
Excuse me.

68
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,475
There's more room on the sidewalk,
folks, please.

69
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,518
-Watch it, man.
-I got blueprints here.

70
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,811
A little help?

71
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,189
A little help, please.

72
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,026
You having a problem with your gun?

73
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,527
Let me help you out with that.

74
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,196
Coming through.

75
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,532
Too much work....

76
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,243
Oh, this is bad.

77
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,703
I'm gonna be right back.

78
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,250
Heads up. Watch out.

79
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,797
Okay. Okay. There you go.

80
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,800
-You okay? You all right?
-You're Spider-Man.

81
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,344
Costume gives it away?
These look pretty important, Max.

82
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,429
"Max"? How do you know my name?

83
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,847
It's written on your badge.

84
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,099
I'm a nobody.

85
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,559
Hey, you're not a nobody.
You're a somebody.

86
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:03,477
Lick that.

87
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,062
All right. Listen to me.

88
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,355
-Now l need you.
-Really?

89
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,065
-You're my eyes and ears out here.
-Okay.

90
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,233
-All right?
-All right.

91
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,609
I'll see you out there.

92
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,863
Warning. Violation of protocol.

93
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,645
Hands up!

94
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,901
Get him, Spidey!

95
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,115
Gotcha. Gotcha. Nope. Got you too.

96
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,620
Hey. No. You.
You're not going anywhere.

97
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,372
Come here. Come here.
Come to Daddy.

98
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,960
Get the hell out of the way!

99
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,879
Okay. Stop it! Stop it!

100
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,424
Oh, come on.

101
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,594
Hey, wait. Come back here.

102
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,138
Heel!

103
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,723
I got you.

104
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,821
Hey, I'm sorry, l'm running a bit late.
I got stuck in some traffic.

105
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,865
Your timing is terrible.
It started already.

106
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,450
-l know, l'm sorry.
-Where are you?

107
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,410
1 st and Broadway, 2nd and Broadway,
3rd and Broadway.

108
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,245
Five minutes. Ten tops.

109
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,207
-Are those sirens?
-No.

110
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,499
-Peter?
-No.

111
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,251
-Peter?
-No sirens.

112
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,920
No--

113
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,713
Peter.

114
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,506
What is happening?

115
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,468
Peter.

116
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,766
Hello?

117
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,229
-Peter? Pe--
-l'll be right there. Promise.

118
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,900
This year's valedictorian,
please welcome Gwen Stacy.

119
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,083
Good morning, esteemed faculty...

120
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,210
...and families of my fellow graduates.

121
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,671
It's an honour to be
standing up here today.

122
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,845
Hello.

123
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,514
-Hey! Get off!
-I told you.

124
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,557
I am running a bit late.

125
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,393
It's over, Spider.

126
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,644
Really?!

127
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,854
I know we all think that we're immortal.

128
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,731
We're supposed to feel that way.

129
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,066
We're graduating.

130
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,987
But, like our brief four years
in high school...

131
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,489
...what makes life valuable...

132
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,866
...is that it doesn't last forever.

133
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,536
What makes it precious
is that it ends.

134
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,580
And l know that now more than ever.

135
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,625
And l say it...

136
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,378
...today of all days...

137
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,256
...to remind us that time is luck.

138
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,555
So don't waste it
living someone else's life.

139
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,474
Make yours count for something.

140
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,852
Fight for what matters to you.

141
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,353
No matter what.

142
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,981
Because even if we fall short...

143
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,984
...what better way is there to live?

144
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,582
I'll take that. That's not yours.

145
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,550
This is not end, Spider!

146
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,097
Michael Oates.

147
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,435
Julia Orchard-Heymans.

148
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,065
Alexis Ortiz.

149
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,029
Bo Parisi.

150
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,116
Peter Parker.

151
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,494
Hey, I think I know that guy.

152
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:31,912
Peter Park--

153
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,708
I'm sorry.

154
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,429
Wait, do that again. Do that again.

155
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:55,102
Peter, for Lord's sakes, l almost stole
a cap and gown to run up there myself.

156
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,522
I'd love to have seen that. That would've
been awesome. No, no, this is for you.

157
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,524
-I am so proud of you.
-You earned it.

158
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,151
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

159
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,987
I know the first thing your Uncle Ben
would say.

160
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,239
Yeah, l know too.

161
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,617
"You better hurry up, party's over.
You gotta get a job."

162
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,035
The second thing he would say:

163
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,955
"Don't just follow the path,
make your own trail."

164
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,456
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

165
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,250
-No.
-What do you mean, no?

166
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,460
Ben told me he made it up.

167
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,297
You really did learn something here.

168
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,845
I wish your uncle
could have been here.

169
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,265
Yeah, me too.

170
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,434
And my folks.

171
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,395
Yeah. Yeah.

172
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,191
-Would've been good.
-Perfect d--

173
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,944
All right, you can go. Go on.

174
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,195
I'll be right back.

175
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,031
-Is that your programme?
-Okay, guys. Get together right now.

176
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,909
A quick one. All right. Cheese.

177
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,744
-Cheese.
-Cheese.

178
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,914
-Okay. I'll just be over here.
-Yeah, just give me two seconds.

179
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,749
-Don't go too far.
-It's good to see you.

180
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,460
-All right.
-All right.

181
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,336
Hey.

182
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,590
Did your traffic jam have anything
to do with the Russian Mob...

183
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,803
...and machine guns by any chance?
Why didn't you just tell me?

184
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,055
What am I gonna do?
You're about to do your speech.

185
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,016
-Gwen. Honey. Family photo.
-Yes?

186
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,100
Okay.

187
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,269
Hey. You coming to dim sum?

188
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,271
Can't keep me away.

189
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,856
It's at 8:00. Don't be late.

190
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,316
-I won't be.
-Okay.

191
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,904
And I'm gonna do my speech for you.

192
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,364
All night? l wanna hear it
all night long.

193
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,658
-Over and over again, all night long.
-Okay.

194
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,577
-Oh, my gosh.
-It was pretty good.

195
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,788
Great. Peter. Join us? Come on.

196
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:44,586
I gotta find my aunt, but
I'm gonna catch up later, thank you.

197
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,671
Hi.

198
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,259
You're gonna make enemies.

199
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,303
People will get hurt.

200
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,224
So l want you to promise me
something, okay?

201
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,353
Leave Gwen out of it.

202
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,106
Promise me that.

203
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,068
She's gonna take
one quick picture, okay?

204
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,250
Peter's outside.
I'm gonna go see if he's okay.

205
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,212
What are you doing? What are you...?

206
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,674
Peter.

207
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:34,844
What is it?

208
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,390
-Hey.
-What's wrong?

209
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,724
Are you all right?

210
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,351
I don't know what l'm doing.

211
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,522
It's my father, isn't it?

212
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,190
Yeah.

213
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,484
I see him everywhere l go.

214
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:54,281
I can't-- I don't know what to do.
And I can't get him out of my head.

215
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,325
-Yeah, but we've talked about this.
-I know, but, Gwen--

216
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,452
-It's not his choice.
-Gwen.

217
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,623
I promised him that
I would keep away from you.

218
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,876
And now l'm gonna come and eat dinner
with your family.

219
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,255
How can l do this?
What does this make me?

220
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,757
I don't know, what does that make you?

221
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,385
It makes me not able to
live with myself.

222
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,267
-I thought that it meant you loved me.
-I do love you.

223
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,645
I love you.

224
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,107
Then why isn't that enough?

225
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,944
Because what if
something happens to you...

226
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,697
...just like it happened to him
because of me?

227
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,117
-No, wait, wait, wait.
-Listen. No, n--

228
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,036
I cannot let that happen.

229
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:42,912
Listen to me.

230
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,831
You're Spider-Man...

231
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,626
...and I love that.

232
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,172
But l love Peter Parker more.

233
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,801
That's worth it to me.

234
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,888
I can't lose you too.

235
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,809
If because you can't lose me,
we can't be together...

236
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,397
...who does that work out for, Peter?

237
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,818
I can't. l'm sorry, Gwen.

238
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,117
You have done this to me...

239
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,830
...again and again, Peter.

240
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,333
I can't live like this.

241
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:36,925
I break up with you.

242
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,425
Good morning, New Yorkers.

243
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,010
Looking for another beautiful day
here in the city.

244
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,554
A few clouds to start us off....

245
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,057
The steady increase in sightings
of Spider-Man has sparked a debate...

246
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,685
...over the role of vigilantism
in American crime fighting.

247
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,936
How about that Spider-Man?

248
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,564
Last night on the Manhattan Bridge,
he saved a dozen lives.

249
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,399
We wanna hear your calls.

250
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,986
l think without Spider-Man,
there'd be no hope for this city.

251
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,364
Who do you think pays the bills
for all the damages he causes, huh?

252
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,699
lt's you and me, taxpayers.

253
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,492
-You make this?
-Yeah.

254
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,619
This is a wind turbine.

255
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,289
You made this? No way.

256
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,957
This is amazing.

257
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,668
It's good as new, right?

258
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,795
I'll walk you home.

259
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,839
-What's your name?
-Jorge.

260
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,300
Jorge? l'm Spider-Man.

261
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,470
l don't feel like my kids are safe
with him out there.

262
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,556
Get out of the way
and let the police do their job.

263
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,935
Some folks think that there might be
more than one Spider-Man.

264
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,396
What do you think?

265
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,315
One guy or many?

266
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,401
l'd love to know
who's behind that mask.

267
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,652
Hey.

268
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,362
-Nice outfit.
-Thanks.

269
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,407
We have a caller on the line named
Max. He says he knows Spider-Man.

270
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,827
Listen, l'm upset. Spider-Man,
to me, is being misunderstood.

271
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,413
He's a very, very good person.
He's protecting us.

272
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,831
He saved my life one time.

273
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,209
We sort of became best friends.

274
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,462
How much?

275
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,922
Hey, you're that spider guy.

276
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:47,138
I'm Spider-Man.

277
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,266
This Spider-Man.... He's not
the police, he's not a fireman.

278
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,311
What gives him the right to get
involved in other people's business?

279
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,427
Peter, honey?

280
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,638
Can l come in?

281
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,599
No!

282
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,893
Peter, the final starts at 9, honey.

283
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,229
You said you would take my car
into the shop...

284
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,939
...because it keeps dying, remember?

285
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,109
Give me a second, Aunt May. l'm gonna
get the door. Just give me a second.

286
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,152
Peter, please just let me in. All right?

287
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,404
I'm trying to get my--

288
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,824
You said your final was at 9, and
you're gonna take my car into the shop.

289
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,743
-No! You can't come in. I'm so naked.
-What are you do--?

290
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,413
Peter! For goodness sakes.

291
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,624
You said you're gonna take my car
into the shop because it kee--!

292
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,836
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. l'm okay.

293
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,212
I'm just--

294
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,006
I'm very naked right now.

295
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,466
What happened to your face?
It's filthy.

296
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,802
-It is?
-Yes.

297
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,847
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I was cleaning the chimney.

298
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:12,932
We have no chimney.

299
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,475
What?

300
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,185
-You're late.
-I know, I'm late.

301
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,062
Downstairs, now.

302
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,065
-Can you leave? Because l'm naked.
-All right, I'm leaving.

303
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,694
-Morning, l love you.
-l love you too. Hurry up.

304
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,029
Well, look who's here.

305
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,447
Spidey.

306
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,282
How was your morning?

307
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,618
Aces, Max, aces.

308
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,870
I've been out saving the world.

309
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,455
Protecting everybody.

310
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,458
But is someone celebrating
a birthday today?

311
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,003
That's why you're here.

312
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,172
You remembered my birthday.

313
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,094
All the crime-fighting you've been doing,
and all of a sudden...

314
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,847
...you take time out to come visit
little old me. Max. lt's amazing to--

315
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,892
But of course you would.

316
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,644
Why wouldn't you visit me?

317
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:41,729
We're best friends.

318
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,069
What are you doing?
You made me a cake?

319
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,489
People don't get a chance to see these
small, kind things that you do for people.

320
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,533
I know what they say about you
in the press...

321
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,910
...but it doesn't matter to me.
I know the real you.

322
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,787
Because you're amazing.

323
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,040
That's what the press needs.

324
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,127
They should call you
The Amazing Spider-Man.

325
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,212
You like that, Spidey?

326
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,381
I like it a lot, Max.

327
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,300
Good. Because today...

328
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,094
...is going to be...

329
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,345

...amazing.

330
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,099
Yeah. Circuit 39.

331
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,981
I'm not late, Harvey.
I'll be there in 1 5 minutes.

332
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,192
I just wanna know if you can find
another waitress...

333
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,113
...to replace me because l start
my training rounds at the hospital.

334
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,907
And don't mention this to Peter.
I don't want him to know.

335
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,451
Because he'll worry.

336
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,078
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, you got it.

337
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,872
Double shift on Thursday.

338
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,623
Okay, bye.

339
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,128
-Who was that?
-Harvey.

340
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,424
-Doing a double shift, huh?
-Sometimes.

341
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,926
Got nothing else to do. I like the girls.

342
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,555
I miss Ben. Gives me a little extra
in the cookie jar.

343
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,977
Well, I sold another couple of photos
to the Bugle, so that ought to help.

344
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,314
Yeah, it would really help if that guy
would pay you a fair wage.

345
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,024
Jameson pays me a fair wage.

346
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,610
If it was 1 961 , he pays me a fair wage.

347
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:14,280
Hey, wait. What are you doing? What
are you doing? No, I do the laundry.

348
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,532
-I'm doing my laundry.
-No, I do the laundry.

349
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:20,286
No, this is my job. l've been doing
your laundry since you were 6 years old.

350
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,163
I understand that. l'm in college now.

351
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,124
I think it's time that I took care of
my own dirty underwear.

352
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,877
Last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red...

353
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,128
-...so no.
-That was a mistake.

354
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,381
Because l was washing
the American flag.

355
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,676
-My-- Can I please just--?
-No one washes a flag.

356
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:36,928
I do, and I won't anymore.

357
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,180
-This is my machine.
-Fine. lt's just underwear.

358
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,849
This is my laundry, my home,
my machine.

359
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,392
Back off, eat your breakfast.

360
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,272
All right, laundry sheriff. I'll do it later.

361
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,857
-I'll do it.
-No, forget it.

362
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,943
-Give it to me.
-I'll do it some other time.

363
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,529
-Hey.
-Excuse me.

364
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,863
Jerk.

365
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:58,991
Not gonna make it.

366
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,664
Logjam. Come on, come on, come on.

367
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,792
-Watch it, buddy.
-Hey, let's go.

368
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,923
Oscorp lndustries...

369
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:18,594
...is proud to announce the world's
first electromagnetic power grid.

370
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:23,182
By converting ageing power stations
into a field of hydroelectric towers...

371
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,936
...we are generating clean, green,
sustainable energy...

372
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,647
...to power Manhattan,
the five boroughs...

373
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,191
...and eventually the world
for generations to come.

374
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,444
-Dillon. You're late.
-Doggone trains are so slow, sir.

375
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,530
Don't you realise Oscorp
is now responsible...

376
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,323
...for the entire city's energy supply?

377
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,534
I submitted a lot of designs
for the power grid...

378
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,911
...and they used a lot of them,
and I noticed that...

379
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,664
...and those power grids
were designed by me.

380
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,082
You designed them?

381
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,459
Sure you did.

382
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,211
And I'm Spider-Man.

383
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,506
You're no Spider-Man!
He's a Leo, you're a Sagittarius!

384
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,885
You besmirch him again, l'm gonna rip
your well-groomed head off!

385
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,095
Now, get to work.

386
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,557
What floor, please?

387
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,101
-Seventy-four.
-Thank you.

388
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,644
Oh, hold that!

389
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,105
-Can you hold that, please?
-I got it.

390
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,316
Thank you, you're a real gentleman.

391
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,359
Most people would have
just let those close.

392
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,236
Most people don't notice other people.

393
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,864
-What floor, please?
-Sixty-three--

394
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,699
I got it. I got it. What is it?

395
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,992
Sixty-three.

396
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,119
Sixty-three, please.

397
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,412
-Thank you.
-In a hurry.

398
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,873
Thank you very much.

399
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,921
I'm Max. Max Dillon.

400
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,505
I'm Gwen.

401
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,549
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

402
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,010
Is it your birthday?

403
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,224
Oh, yeah. Well, I-- They--
Friends of mine made this flyer up.

404
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,019
I'm having a birthday party
at a big club. A lot of celebrities.

405
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,314
Would love to invite you,
it's just that the guest list is closed.

406
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,776
Oh, got it. Got it.
Well, thank you anyway.

407
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,653
-...dressed as Spider-Man...
-That's exciting.

408
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,196
...hanging out near the blaze.

409
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,866
It must be cool, huh? To have
the whole world look at you like that?

410
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,328
You know, Spider-Man
saved my life one time.

411
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,414
Out of all the people
in the whole city, he saved...

412
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,666
...me.

413
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,542
He said he needed me.

414
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,796
That must be a good feeling.

415
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,340
Sixty-third floor.

416
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,842
It was nice to meet you, Max.

417
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,555
Wait. She remembered my name.

418
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,241
Welcome home.

419
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,671
It's dark in there.

420
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,007
Your eyes will adjust.

421
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,176
It's better this way.

422
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,540
Dad.

423
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,216
This is not how I imagined
I would die.

424
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,303
Looking at my son...

425
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,638
...and seeing a stranger.

426
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,560
You have such potential, Harry.

427
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,481
Such fierce intelligence...

428
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,566
...and you're throwing it all away.

429
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,818
No, you threw me away.

430
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:08,240
You kicked me off to boarding school
when l was 1 1 .

431
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,036
On my 1 6th birthday...

432
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,996
...you sent me Scotch.

433
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,332
Or one of your assistants did.

434
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,418
I'm pretty sure because the card read:

435
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:24,048
"With compliments, Norman Osborn."

436
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,009
I don't expect forgiveness from you...

437
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,761
...anymore.

438
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,598
I don't believe in miracles.

439
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,559
How could you possibly understand...

440
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:39,605
...that your childhood
had to be sacrificed...

441
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,607
...for something greater?

442
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,276
And not just for me.

443
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,945
For you!

444
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,158
Has your hand started to twitch yet?

445
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,705
When you lay awake
and you feel it coming...

446
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,750
...hiding under your skin...

447
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,087
...waiting to show itself.

448
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,673
To show you...

449
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,717
...who you really are.

450
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,516
Retroviral hyperplasia.

451
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,812
I never told you...

452
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,065
...that it's genetic.

453
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,735
Our disease...

454
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,072
...the Osborn curse.

455
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,451
And it began at your age.

456
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,245
Let me see it.

457
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,332
Your hand. Give it to me.

458
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:51,802
The greatest inheritance
I can give you...

459
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,929
...isn't merely money.

460
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,181
It's this.

461
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,351
The sum total of all my work.

462
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,564
Everything l did to stay alive.

463
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,275
Maybe you can succeed...

464
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,527
...where l failed.

465
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,345
Norman Osborn, the legendary
founder and CEO...

466
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,722
...of Oscorp lndustries, has died...

467
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,641
...the Osborn estate has confirmed.

468
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,185
He is survived by his only son,
Harry Osborn...

469
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,271
...who is the sole heir
of the Oscorp corporate empire.

470
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,731
Harry.

471
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,900
Osborn changed
the medical profession's approach...

472
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,193
...to human healing...

473
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,820
...and affected the lives of millions.

474
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:56,534
l started Oscorp because l looked at
the world around me and l thought:

475
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,245
"We can do better.
And we should do better."

476
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:04,875
Einstein said, "The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking."

477
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,628
But change isn't just a slogan.

478
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,755
lt begins with hard work.

479
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,425
Change begins with
persistence and commitment.

480
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,179
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

481
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:21,684
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.

482
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,602
But not today.

483
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,729
Today is for mourning.

484
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,107
-Hello?
-ls this Gwen Stacy?

485
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,483
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

486
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,569
l'm calling from
the Oxford Scholars Programme.

487
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,571
We have some exciting news.

488
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,911
-Dillon. You stay here.
-What?

489
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,872
There's a current flow problem in
the lab. Why don't you take a look?

490
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,750
It's my birthday. Everybody else
is leaving. Why do l have to stay?

491
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,295
-Because you're special.
-Smythe.

492
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:50,921
I mean, Mr. Smythe.

493
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,715
Happy birthday.

494
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,846
Bioelectrogenesis:

495
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,891
The generation of electricity
by living organisms to fend off--

496
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,185
Let's see what's going on with you.
Hey, guys.

497
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,437
The genetically manipulated--

498
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,522
At least somebody's partying.

499
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,358
All right. Just a little sick.

500
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,945
I got your medicine, though.

501
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,617
I'm so sick that I can't get to my birthday
after all l put together for this company.

502
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:20,951
Designed the grid....

503
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,704
-Warning:
-I should've stretched.

504
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,624
-Malfunction in Sector 5A.
-I know. Just a little indigestion.

505
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,376
I bet you didn't know it was
my birthday, did you, Kari?

506
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,587
Think you can sing "Happy Birthday"
for me?

507
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,797
I'll just have to sing it for myself.

508
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,299
-Gilbert?
-What?

509
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,053
It's Max. Can we shut down power
on Sector 32, please?

510
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,429
Forget it. l'm out the door.

511
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,473
What do you mean?
I'm up here. It's dangerous.

512
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,058
-Sorry, Max.
-Hello?

513
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,897
Fine. l'll do it myself.
And sing my birthday song too.

514
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,857
This is crazy.

515
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,000
System restored.

516
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,627
Have a nice day.

517
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,587
Harry...

518
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,673
...Oscorp's been under
intense public scrutiny...

519
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,092
...in the wake of Dr. Connors' recent...

520
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,427
...breach of trust.

521
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,011
You mean people are pissed off...

522
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,181
...because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.

523
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,685
Given that...

524
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:13,355
...all the animal hybrid programmes
he was involved in were destroyed...

525
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,858
...to restore investor confidence.

526
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,695
That is the Osborn way.

527
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,532
Whatever's inconvenient around here,
just get rid of it, right?

528
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:27,286
Much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now.

529
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,664
We felt that plausible deniability
was your best option.

530
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,666
Sure, sure. l get it.

531
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,169
Twenty-year-old kid.

532
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,087
Two hundred billion dollar company.

533
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,922
What was Dad thinking?

534
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,675
I mean, you're all lawyers, right?

535
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,347
Surely, someone must've questioned
his sanity in the end.

536
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,809
Someone must've thought about having
him declared legally incompetent.

537
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,187
It would've made this conversation
a lot easier.

538
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,731
-Harry--
-It's Mr. Osborn.

539
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,109
We're not friends.

540
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,824
Hi.

541
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,581
You were his assistant, right?

542
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,544
What's your name?

543
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,881
Felicia.

544
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,716
From now on...

545
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,762
...everybody at this table
works for Felicia...

546
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,557
...because Felicia works for me.

547
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,894
Would anybody like to speak up?

548
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,525
Well, good. Then you can all
keep your jobs a little longer.

549
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,154
Sir, there's a Peter Parker
here to see you.

550
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,582
Felicia, l wanna see every file
on this list.

551
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,836
Every single one.

552
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,886
Peter Parker.

553
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,265
It's like seeing a ghost.

554
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,767
Hey, Harry.

555
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,811
Random.

556
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,647
-What, 1 0 years.
-It's eight.

557
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,233
But you're close.

558
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,569
What's up?

559
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,904
I saw the news, man.

560
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,366
I heard about your dad
and I wanted to come and--

561
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:33,620
Just wanted to come and see you.
Check to see how you were doing.

562
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,373
I'm with some people.

563
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,128
I'm in a....

564
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:42,921
I'm in a meeting.

565
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,756
I'm sorry, l don't wanna intrude.

566
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,508
I know it's been a long time.

567
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,803
I kind of know exactly
what you're going through right now.

568
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,639
And you were so there for me
when my parents....

569
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,976
Well, that's why l'm here for you.

570
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:57,811
Thank you.

571
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,899
It's good to see you, man.

572
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,611
It's good to see you.

573
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,405
I'm sorry about your dad.

574
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,535
You got your braces off.

575
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,918
Now there's nothing to distract
from your unibrow.

576
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,799
There he is.

577
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,844
You still blow-dry your hair
every morning?

578
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:35,766
You know, one of my manservants
holds the hair dryer...

579
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,809
...but l work the comb, okay?

580
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:42,064
So at least l'm not completely helpless.

581
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,316
You're stupid.

582
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:53,200
After graduation, l went to Brazil,
then Singapore.

583
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,451
-That's right, yeah.
-Yeah.

584
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,495
And then Europe.
You know, I went to Europe.

585
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:57,871
I saw you.

586
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,957
What do you mean, you saw me?

587
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,417
I saw you in some magazine
with some French supermodel.

588
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,419
You know what l'm talking about?

589
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,046
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,341
Dude, that whole model thing
is so exhausting.

591
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,926
I know.

592
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,346
What?

593
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,556
You got a lady?

594
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:25,440
That's a question.

595
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:26,942
Whoa, buddy.

596
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,528
No, I don't.

597
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,697
Yeah.

598
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,157
I don't know. It's....

599
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,538
I don't know. It's complicated.

600
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,623
Yeah, l don't do complicated.

601
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,586
What's her name? Who is she?

602
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:47,963
Her name's Gwen.

603
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,881
Gwen Stacy.

604
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,385
-Gwen Stacy.
-She works for you.

605
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,095
Really? She works for me?

606
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,640
-She does work-study at Oscorp.
-Is she a model employee?

607
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,853
You know, when my father
sent me away...

608
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,981
...I tried to forget
everything about this place.

609
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,402
I guess that kind of included you.

610
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,033
You ain't gotta explain anything
to me, man.

611
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,327
We both got dumped.

612
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,333
You ever figure out
why your parents bailed?

613
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,089
My dad left a briefcase.

614
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,092
That's all I got, briefcase full of junk.

615
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,636
Whatever. l don't know.
I try not to think about it.

616
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,680
How's that working out for you?

617
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,724
Perfectly.

618
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,107
Dude. Nice arm.

619
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,985
It's just the wrist. lt's just all
in the wrist, buddy.

620
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,404
You could do it too
if you just strengthened up that.

621
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:55,947
Yeah, right.

622
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,701
You gotta admit, though. Things
have gotten crazy around here, man.

623
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,037
Giant lizards...

624
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,539
...and spider guys.

625
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,461
Just one guy. Just one spider man.

626
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,006
Or woman. We don't know for sure.

627
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:17,344
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex
to rescue kittens from trees.

628
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,679
I'm so impressed.

629
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,015
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.

630
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,892
For what?

631
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,853
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.

632
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,523
Yeah, l just wish l had time
for "eventually."

633
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:34,820
Who was he?

634
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,823
Maxwell Dillon. Electrical engineer.

635
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,826
No associates or friends to speak of.

636
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,412
He submitted specs for the grid
that we appropriated.

637
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:45,789
The guy was...

638
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,749
...invisible.

639
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:52,587
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child, Harry, taking over.

640
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,840
We've gotta find a way to get him out.

641
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:59,719
In the meantime, if the press gets hold
of this accident, our stock will crater.

642
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,807
So make sure this Mr. Dillon
stays invisible.

643
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,436
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

644
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,671
Hey.

645
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,283
Hey, moron! Get out of the street!

646
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,882
Hey. Hi.

647
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:03,927
Hi.

648
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,471
You look amazing.

649
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:12,143
I'm sorry for the spontaneous
outreach. It was kind of....

650
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,854
No. I don't-- l-- Spontaneous...

651
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,232
...is all right. You know.

652
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,943
Well, I just figured it was time.

653
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,279
You know?

654
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,447
Time that we try to be friends.

655
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:26,950
Yeah.

656
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,204
Friends, yeah. That's...

657
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,331
...great.

658
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,834
I just don't want us
to be complicated.

659
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,253
I was just saying that to someone.
I hate complicated.

660
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,088
Keep it simple.

661
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,050
Okay, great, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right.

662
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,552
Well, I mean....

663
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:52,684
If we're gonna be friends, l think
we gotta establish some ground rules.

664
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,186
-Some ground rules?
-Yeah, some ground rules.

665
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:56,813
Like that.

666
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,273
Like what?

667
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,776
-That laugh. That laugh.
-What?

668
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,570
That's off the table.

669
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,530
-My laugh is off the table?
-Off the table.

670
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,074
You gotta figure out
a more annoying laugh.

671
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,245
That's still adorable.

672
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,998
-That was not adorable.
-It's adorable.

673
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,458
No, it's not adorable.

674
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:19,377
-Okay. I have a ground rule.
-Oh, good.

675
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,879
What is it?

676
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,757
Don't tell me that l look amazing...

677
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:28,053
...with your big brown doe eyes. Okay?

678
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,097
I'm really serious about that one.

679
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,309
-Oh, no.
-What?

680
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,353
I just figured out the next ground rule.

681
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:37,771
What?

682
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,522
No more of this.

683
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,733
No more of this little nose rub
that you do.

684
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,568
-This?
-Don't think I haven't-- Hey.

685
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,529
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

686
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,198
This is killing me.

687
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,950
You're just spitting in the face
of my ground rules. l'm out.

688
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,452
Come on.

689
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,456
First we get ice cream,
and then I'm out.

690
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:36,538
Yeah. So l did that.

691
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:41,668
And I got completely addicted to
this place that has Korean meatballs.

692
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,587
-Yeah. No, l know.
-Have you been there? lt's mind-blowing.

693
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,257
That place on 6th. I know.
You love it there.

694
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:51,678
How do you know that?

695
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,558
How do you know I love it there?

696
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,518
Because....

697
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,397
Because you told me.

698
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,694
It just opened last month.

699
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,283
Have you been following me?

700
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,123
I knew it.

701
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,000
How often?

702
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,088
Just once a day.

703
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,673
Sometimes.

704
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,760
Sometimes more.

705
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,892
Oh, boy.

706
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:40,393
Why?

707
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,483
Make sure I'm safe?

708
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,194
-And....
-And what?

709
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:52,864
And because it's the closest I can get
to still being with you.

710
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,212
I'm moving to England.

711
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,846
What?

712
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,806
Yeah.

713
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:22,852
I have a--
I'm up for a scholarship to Oxford.

714
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,106
In molecular medicine.
And it's between me and this other kid.

715
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,234
There's this oral exam
that we have to do...

716
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,237
...and he's, like, a freshman
in college, but he's 1 4.

717
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:34,364
And-- And it's-- lt could be him.

718
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,407
But it might be me. l hope it's me.

719
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,953
And I'm thinking that
I'll be moving to England.

720
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,164
Yeah.

721
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,166
And I'm really excited.

722
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:47,919
That's....

723
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,507
England.

724
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,678
What?

725
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,111
Station, l need a 1 0-85.

726
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,364
Send out additional units to
the south-end corner of Duffy Square.

727
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,491
Folks, could you step to the side?

728
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:02,869
Everybody get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

729
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,748
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables right now!

730
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,917
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables!

731
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,128
Let me see your hands, please!

732
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,173
You stay right where you are!

733
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:16,633
Do not move!

734
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,010
Freeze! Get down! On the ground!

735
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,529
Get down on the ground, now!

736
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:41,407
-Stop!
-Get your ass down on the ground! Now!

737
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,326
-It's not my fault!
-Sir!

738
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,952
-Stop!
-I'm gonna need for you...

739
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,913
-Please!
-...to get down on the ground, now!

740
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,375
For your own safety and the safety
of the other patrons in this area.

741
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,253
Oh, my gosh.

742
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,299
They see me. You see me.

743
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,803
You see me.

744
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,888
They see me.

745
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,944
-No! No! Stop!
-On the ground now!

746
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,822
-Don't do that. Please!
-It's over, freak!

747
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,366
Wait! lt's not my fault.

748
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:24,617
It's not my fault!

749
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:28,996
I said stop!

750
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,588
I'm glad you're not one of those cops
that rides a horse.

751
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,348
All team members, hold your fire
and wait for my call.

752
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:54,313
All units, hold your fire! l repeat,
hold your fire! Stand down!

753
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,359
Stop. Stop it.

754
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,736
Yo, Sparkles!

755
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,655
Hey, how you doing?

756
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,159
-It's you?
-Yeah, l know it's me.

757
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,285
Who are you?

758
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,329
You don't remember me?

759
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,707
No. Should l?

760
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:16,753
I walked into the street. The car
almost hit me. You swooped me up.

761
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,421
You saved me.

762
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,339
You said you needed me.

763
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,259
-You're the guy with the blueprints.
-Yes.

764
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:24,719
Blueprints.

765
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:29,849
Yes, l remember you. Of course l
remember you. You're my eyes and ears.

766
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,894
-What's your name again?
-How could you forget me?

767
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,563
-I do, l know it, l know it, don't tell me.
-It's Max.

768
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,607
-Is it "Max"?
-Yes.

769
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,776
I'm sorry I didn't recognise you
with the--

770
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,694
You look different.

771
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,404
How are you?

772
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,490
I don't know what's going on with me.

773
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,784
I can see that. I can-- I believe you.

774
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:53,331
It's strange, the power l feel.
I got so much....

775
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,500
I got so much anger.

776
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:58,503
I can see that. I can see you don't
wanna be here and you're scared.

777
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,505
I see you don't know
what's happening to you.

778
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,507
I can see you don't want to
hurt anybody.

779
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,343
-It's gonna be all right.
-Got a clear shot. Standing by.

780
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:07,512
-I don't want them shooting me anymore.
-They won't.

781
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:10,264
You guys. This is my buddy, Max.

782
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:13,851
I told you about Max.
No one shoots at Max!

783
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,354
You and me, okay?
It's just you and me talking.

784
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,982
Stay right there. Just be careful.
The grate, because of the electricity.

785
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,234
I just--

786
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,862
I just wanted everyone to see me.

787
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,031
He makes a move, you take that shot.

788
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,200
How about you come with me?
We'll go talk.

789
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,244
Away from all these people, okay?

790
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:32,453
Yeah, yes.

791
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,248
No! No! Stop!

792
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,127
Max!

793
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,357
Spidey, Spidey, Spidey!

794
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:05,069
You stupid freak!

795
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,952
Electro dummy!

796
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,169
Get out of here, you freak!

797
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:23,421
Shut up!

798
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,717
You're so selfish.

799
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,094
Stay with me, Max.

800
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,637
You set me up.

801
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,097
No, I didn't set you up.

802
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,849
You lied to me!

803
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,851
No, I'm trying to help you.
Let me help you.

804
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:25,983
Are you all right?

805
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,407
It's my birthday.

806
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,618
Now it's time for me
to light my candles.

807
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,740
Do we have visual on Spider-Man?

808
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:59,285
Does anyone have visual
on Spider-Man?

809
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,923
Okay. All right, that's enough. All right.

810
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:14,550
-Mike.
-Yeah.

811
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,052
-Big John.
-Nice job.

812
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,720
Nice work, fellas.

813
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,765
It's a pleasure doing business
with you.

814
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,274
Spider-Man.

815
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,948
England?

816
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,701
Really?

817
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:51,962
Good talk.

818
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,816
Our coverage of this breaking story...

819
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:14,318
...begins with New York 1 's
Jessica Abo at the scene.

820
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,987
That's right. We're standing here
with two eyewitnesses...

821
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,073
...who are going to tell us
what they just saw.

822
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,075
Tell us, how do you think
Spider-Man did it?

823
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,868
How do you think
he beat this creature?

824
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,912
Yeah, it's gotta be rubberized,
Spidey's suit.

825
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,705
That's why he didn't get electrocuted.

826
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,250
Probably some kind of neoprene.
That's what l'd use.

827
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,001
Thank you very much
to the two of you.

828
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:33,712
As you can tell, so many questions
remain unanswered.

829
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,423
We will bring you the latest information
as it becomes available.

830
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:39,009
For now, Jessica Abo, New York 1 .
Let's send it back to you.

831
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:29,703
Online polls show a sudden uptick...

832
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:32,331
...in public sentiment
in favour of the web-crawler.

833
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,418
Tonight, it would seem New York City
owes him a debt of gratitude.

834
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,035
Next-generation military body armour.

835
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:14,290
Features include enhanced mobility,
battlefield injury repair...

836
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,834
...direct nervous system interface.

837
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,053
So the common household spider...

838
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:29,638
...unlike human cells...

839
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,474
...theirs contain the power
to self-heal...

840
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:36,270
...from severe infection,
tissue damage, et cetera.

841
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:41,108
We've used a radioactive isotope
with compatible human DNA.

842
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:46,238
Welcome to Dr. Jallings,
Science lnvestigator.

843
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:49,325
Today we're going to be
talking about electricity.

844
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:52,619
Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic currents.

845
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,372
Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges.

846
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:58,792
The more powerful the battery,
the bigger the charge it can withstand.

847
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:02,796
But if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge...

848
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,382
...the battery might explode!

849
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,217
Explode!

850
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,890
When doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.

851
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:14,266
You're not invincible.

852
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,435
We're gonna need a bigger battery.

853
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,311
-Hello.
-Pete.

854
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,188
lt's me.

855
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,148
Hey, Harry. What--?

856
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,943
What time is it?

857
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:09,988
Late, early, I don't know.
l've been up all night.

858
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,698
l need to see you.

859
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,158
You all right?

860
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,785
Not really, Pete.

861
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,495
l'm dying.

862
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,498
But I think you can help
save my life.

863
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,087
You're looking at the world's first
human-spider hybrids.

864
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,215
The hope is to extract the venom
from their glands...

865
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,884
...and turn that into a cure.

866
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,720
An agent that heals diseased cells.

867
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:39,101
And if l can be cured, imagine what
this could do for other diseases...

868
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,437
...like Alzheimer's, even cancer.

869
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:48,026
They never made it to human trials.

870
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,989
It's 14 years of research,
and nothing to show for it.

871
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:56,452
Except maybe this.

872
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,086
Spider-Man.

873
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,338
What about him?

874
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:12,009
He was bitten by one of those things,
and it worked.

875
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,263
I don't know how
and I don't know why...

876
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:20,142
...but he can do everything else
a spider can...

877
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,519
...including self-heal.

878
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,480
I need to find him.

879
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:26,857
I need his blood.

880
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,749
You need...

881
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,002
...Spider-Man's blood?

882
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,633
It'll save my life.

883
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,968
It may not, Har.

884
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,554
It may not be that simple.

885
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,556
You saw what happened
to Curt Connors, right?

886
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:00,807
Connors was weak.

887
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:03,310
This is me, Peter.

888
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,646
I don't think you can just set up a van...

889
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:07,814
...and have him donate.

890
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:13,278
I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive about
people shoving needles and--

891
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:14,655
He's sensitive, okay.

892
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:19,910
Well, then, maybe you could just
sensitively tell me where he is...

893
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,454
...and I will go ask him myself.

894
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:23,956
What?

895
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,961
-You took his picture.
-So?

896
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,213
-You know him.
-Harry.

897
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,758
I took a picture from a long way away.
I used a long lens.

898
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,218
I don't know him.

899
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,014
I put together what you said
at the river.

900
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,310
-What l--
-About how he gives people hope.

901
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:48,730
Come on.

902
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,537
What in the--?

903
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,043
Just say yes.

904
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,885
Don't turn your back on me!

905
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,681
I don't wanna end up
like my father, Peter.

906
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,809
Please.

907
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,021
Peter, please.

908
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,647
I can't.

909
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:35,694
Please.

910
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:42,200
I'm gonna try...

911
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:44,703
...and find Spider-Man.

912
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:57,758
-Hey, what's security doing over here?
-That's so weird.

913
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:58,884
She's right over there.

914
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,768
Hey! Miss Stacy!

915
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:26,536
Hi.

916
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:30,248
What are you doing here?

917
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,293
Come here.

918
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:42,052
She's not here. Check another floor.

919
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:43,679
-Got it.
-Yes, sir!

920
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,013
You're in trouble.

921
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,431
-Yeah.
-Who's that guy?

922
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:49,434
There was an accident in the genomics
lab, and they're covering it up.

923
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,938
And I found out. That guy
from Times Square last night?

924
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,358
I met him. He was an electrical
engineer in the building.

925
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,569
And he loved Spider-Man, by the way.
He was, like, a fanatic.

926
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:03,448
I didn't get love vibes. l got more of a
"want to kill me with his electricity" vibe.

927
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,742
That's actually kind of what it's like
to love you.

928
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:10,038
I was searching for him in the computer
and all the files, he's erased.

929
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,540
-My God.
-He's completely erased.

930
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:12,999
That's Oscorp.

931
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,127
And what about you? Why are you here?

932
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:16,420
Harry.

933
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:18,130
-Osborn?
-He's dying.

934
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:19,923
-What do you mean?
-He's dying.

935
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,592
And he thinks the only thing
that's gonna save his life...

936
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,512
...is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood.

937
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,223
And as far as I know, if I
give it to him, it could kill him.

938
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,267
Or something worse.

939
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,060
I know.

940
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,771
This is the maintenance closet, Gwen.

941
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:38,191
This is the most clichéd hiding place
you could've chosen.

942
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,402
-This is the stupidest hiding place.
-I'm sorry...

943
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:44,614
...I didn't take us to the Bahamas
of hiding places.

944
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:48,618
I gotta talk to you about England,
I guess, because l don't....

945
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:01,423
-You just kissed me.
-I know, I'm sorry. l couldn't help it.

946
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:03,467
How'd you like it?

947
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:05,302
It felt a little bit rushed.

948
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:07,679
I know. I know, l know.

949
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,683
This is the plan. You get to the elevator.
I'm gonna distract him, okay?

950
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:12,851
Okay.

951
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,493
-God! Damn it!
-I'm so--

952
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:32,954
I just spilled a hot latte all over your--
I didn't mean to do that. Oh, no!

953
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:35,040
And you too? l'm sorry.

954
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,792
-Miss! Stay right there!
-Sir.

955
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,294
-Just stay right--
-Wait, wait, wait.

956
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:40,545
Hey! Stop!

957
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:44,007
All right. On your way.

958
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,510
I'm sorry. l'm all thumbs today.

959
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,475
-Gwen Stacy.
-Oh, my God.

960
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,727
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

961
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,312
No, it's okay.

962
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,482
I'm-- I'm Harry.

963
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,192
Yeah.

964
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:06,571
-I'm an old friend of Peter's.
-Yeah, l know who you are. Sorry.

965
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,448
I was kind of rushing.

966
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,117
No, I'm sorry
he never introduced us.

967
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,453
I thought you two had broken up.

968
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,667
Yeah. Yes, we had.

969
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:20,460
And it's....

970
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,587
-It's complicated.
-Complicated. Yeah.

971
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:26,049
I mean, it's Peter. Everything's
always complicated with Peter.

972
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:29,094
Yeah.

973
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:31,263
Yeah, you're right.

974
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,598
But that's why he needs you.

975
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:36,434
Right?

976
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:41,106
To help him make his choices clear.

977
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:45,944
Nice to meet you, Harry.

978
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,197
Yeah, it's such a pleasure, Gwen.

979
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,131
You've been in a terrible accident.

980
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,384
I'm Dr. Kafka.

981
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:53,970
I'm here to help you.

982
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:55,931
Course you are, doc.

983
01:13:56,974 --> 01:14:01,061
That's why you're preparing
military-grade biostim electrodes.

984
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,647
High-intensity capacitors.

985
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,107
The kind they make at Oscorp.

986
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,277
All of this
because you're trying to help me.

987
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,695
You are correct.

988
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:13,031
I'm here to study you.

989
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:17,953
To understand what you are,
why you are.

990
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,080
Und l will get results.

991
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,295
I always do.

992
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:31,466
You do realise...

993
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,885
...you locked me in a prison...

994
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:35,720
...that runs...

995
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,806
...on electricity?

996
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,936
I can feel it in the walls.

997
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,105
I can feel it in my veins.

998
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,650
No matter what you do, doc,
you can't contain it.

999
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,236
It's a force of nature.

1000
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:53,905
Like me.

1001
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:02,872
You wanna know how powerful l am?

1002
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,375
Well, so do l.

1003
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:13,174
I'm dying to know...

1004
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,010
...doc.

1005
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:18,763
But you better make damn sure
you kill me this time.

1006
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,515
Because if you don't...

1007
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,184
...I'm gonna kill the light.

1008
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:27,897
So everyone in this city is gonna know
how it feels to live in my world.

1009
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:30,608
A world without power.

1010
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,236
A world without mercy.

1011
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,030
A world...

1012
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:36,906
...without Spider-Man.

1013
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:41,703
And everyone will be able to see me
for who l truly am.

1014
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,372
And who are you?

1015
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,374
Don't you know?

1016
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,251
I'm Electro.

1017
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:56,801
Warning: Electrical restraint
capacity reached.

1018
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,804
lnitiate lockdown procedure
immediately.

1019
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,681
Very impressive...

1020
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,309
...Electro.

1021
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,936
Lockdown initiated.

1022
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,159
Aunt May?

1023
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:27,916
What are you doing?

1024
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,793
When did you do this?

1025
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,930
There's something
you're not telling me, Aunt May.

1026
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:45,183
Every time l mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

1027
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,728
I know you're not telling me something.
You lie to me. l know you love me.

1028
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,814
-I don't lie.
-I know you love me, but you do.

1029
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:52,440
Aunt May, Aunt May.

1030
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,235
You have to tell me, May.

1031
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:57,445
That's my father.

1032
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,114
Yes, he was your father.

1033
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,991
But that didn't seem to stop him
from leaving you...

1034
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:03,868
...here.

1035
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:06,996
I need the truth.

1036
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,793
The truth is, your parents
left you here, on our doorstep.

1037
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,795
You were this little boy
whose whole world...

1038
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,756
...was turned upside down
with no explanation.

1039
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:21,761
We did the best we could,
your Uncle Ben and I.

1040
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:25,598
I mean, who else was gonna care for you,
and protect you and worry about you?

1041
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,100
Your father?

1042
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:28,518
No.

1043
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:32,897
I was the one who wiped your nose,
and made you brush your teeth...

1044
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,817
...and do your homework,
or washed your dirty underwear. Me!

1045
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:40,780
Your stupid, non-scientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet...

1046
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:42,657
...who has to take nursing classes...

1047
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,785
...with 22-year-old kids so l can
pay for you to go to college.

1048
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:48,121
And I don't know how to do this
without Ben.

1049
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:49,497
I don't know how. And--

1050
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,459
And you're dreaming about
your perfect father...

1051
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:56,379
...who was never here. No.

1052
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,090
No, I won't tell you.

1053
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,466
You're my boy.

1054
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:03,052
As far as l'm concerned,
you're my boy.

1055
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:04,387
And I won't hurt you.

1056
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:15,732
I'm your boy.

1057
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:17,734
You're my everything.

1058
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:22,447
You're enough.
You're more than enough.

1059
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,116
That's not what this is about.
Don't get that twisted.

1060
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,995
-I love you so much.
-I know.

1061
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:37,670
It's okay.

1062
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:41,799
May.

1063
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:47,096
I need to know.

1064
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:52,936
All right.

1065
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:58,399
I'll tell you everything I know.

1066
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,862
But it will hurt you.

1067
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,073
Okay.

1068
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:10,203
A few days after the funeral...

1069
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:14,207
...two government men came to see us.

1070
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:19,170
They said the genetics research...

1071
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,882
...that your father was doing with
Norman Osborn was very valuable...

1072
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:25,760
...and that people
would pay a lot for it.

1073
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,012
And that's why he ran off with it.

1074
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,973
They said he was a traitor.

1075
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:31,975
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

1076
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,144
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us...

1077
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:36,854
...for the money.

1078
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,232
I don't--

1079
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,070
Oh, I don't get it. No, l don't--
This doesn't make sense.

1080
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:47,949
Yes, l know. l know. l didn't
believe it either. l didn't believe it.

1081
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,450
It doesn't make any sense.

1082
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:50,910
Peter, I don't know.

1083
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:54,372
For so long, l would play it over
and over and over in my head.

1084
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,874
What had l missed?
What had l missed?

1085
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:59,627
He was just this
normal, unassuming guy.

1086
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:02,964
He wore the same ratty lab coat
for 20 years.

1087
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,883
He took the D train to work
at 7 every morning.

1088
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,303
Came home at 6 every night.

1089
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:10,888
I don't know.

1090
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:14,684
Maybe everyone has
a part of themselves they hide.

1091
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,229
Even from the people they love.

1092
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:30,158
Peter.

1093
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,705
Mr. Osborn.

1094
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:41,878
Look up.

1095
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:44,630
Think you're looking for me.

1096
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,552
I cannot believe my eyes.

1097
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,597
Spider-Man.

1098
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,898
Just the man I wanted to see.

1099
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,027
You...

1100
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,946
...talked to Peter?

1101
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:10,907
Yeah.

1102
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:20,208
I wanna help you, Mr. Osborn.
I really, really do.

1103
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:24,921
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

1104
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:26,297
Excuse me?

1105
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,008
It's too dangerous.

1106
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,261
If our blood is incompatible,
you could die.

1107
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,515
I'm already dying.

1108
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:39,268
Your blood can't make me die more.

1109
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,270
But it could do something worse.

1110
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,191
Okay.

1111
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,569
All right, how much?

1112
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:51,114
-How much what?
-How much do you want? Name it.

1113
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:55,326
You want a boat? You want a plane? You
want money? How much do you want?

1114
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,830
-I don't want your money.
-Come on. Everybody wants my money!

1115
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:00,665
I don't.

1116
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:04,377
I thought you....

1117
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:07,547
I thought you were supposed to
save people.

1118
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,260
I thought that's what you do,
is you save people's lives.

1119
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:14,804
You're-- You're just gonna let me die.

1120
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,266
-I'm trying to protect you right now.
-No. No, you are not.

1121
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:20,935
You're trying to protect yourself.

1122
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:25,731
Look, we just need a bit more time...

1123
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,650
-...to figure out something else.
-I do not have time!

1124
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:36,576
I'm sorry.

1125
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,920
You're a fraud, Spider-Man!

1126
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,437
-Hey! Hi.
-Hi.

1127
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:07,607
-Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second.
-I'm running late right now.

1128
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:10,443
-It's just gonna take a second.
-I can't. l'm sorry, Peter.

1129
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,988
Just give me one minute. l just
wanna say one thing and l'm gone.

1130
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,199
Everything's a mess.
Everything's insane.

1131
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:19,035
My dad, my mom.
Everything l thought about them? Lies.

1132
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:21,829
Lies. Lies, lies, lies.
Nothing makes any sense anymore.

1133
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,915
I gotta figure out what l'm gonna do
with Harry.

1134
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,625
Of course I wanna save him.
You know?

1135
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:27,502
I wanna save him
because he's my best pal.

1136
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:30,588
And what if my blood works?
But what if it doesn't?

1137
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,340
I don't know. I got no idea.

1138
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,844
-Oh, God.
-I got nothing. I got nothing.

1139
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,847
The only thing I keep
coming back to, Gwen, is....

1140
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:42,642
Ms. Stacy?

1141
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:44,435
Shall I take you upstairs?

1142
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:47,063
Yes. l'm so sorry.

1143
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:51,484
I'm so sorry. l'm already late.
Can l have just one more minute?

1144
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,528
-Okay.
-Thank you. l'm sorry.

1145
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:56,948
-I'm-- Okay. l have to be--
-Where are we?

1146
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,574
I'm at my...

1147
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:01,994
...last interview for Oxford
right now.

1148
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,873
-Oxford. l didn't know.
-Yeah.

1149
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:08,417
Okay, well....

1150
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:10,545
I'm sorry to bother you...

1151
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,380
...my fair lady-- Madam.

1152
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:14,382
But who am l?

1153
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,175
I mean, who am I? l'm John Hopkins.

1154
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:18,469
I'm one of the young professors
at Harvard...

1155
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,681
...and I've been trying to get her
to be in my....

1156
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:24,642
Be a part of my team for a while now.

1157
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:27,812
And she's just the best person l know
and a scientific genius.

1158
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,063
And....

1159
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,731
Anyway, God save the queen.

1160
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:32,775
-I'm sorry everything's happening--
-Can you wait?

1161
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:34,527
Peter. Peter.

1162
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,362
What do you want to say to me?

1163
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:38,656
What's the "one thing"?

1164
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:44,579
I have to go to England, Peter.

1165
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:47,957
It's important to me.

1166
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,965
I mean, I don't know. Maybe
we're on different paths right now.

1167
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:58,718
You know? l don't know.

1168
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:00,303
Maybe we're just...

1169
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:02,346
...going different ways. I don't--

1170
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,682
I've gotta go. l gotta go.

1171
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:08,811
Gwen.

1172
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,107
Good luck.

1173
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:18,946
Hi. Sorry.

1174
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:22,468
He took the D train every morning
at 7 to work.

1175
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:25,513
Came home at 6:00 every evening.

1176
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,022
"Roosevelt's secret station.

1177
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:37,650
Track 61 , a secret
subterranean extension...

1178
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:40,611
...of New York's D Line train
under Pershing Square...

1179
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:44,490
...built to transport President Franklin
Roosevelt away from the public eye...

1180
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:48,160
...to keep his polio hidden
from the American people."

1181
01:26:58,338 --> 01:26:59,630
Mr. Osborn?

1182
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:02,508
You all right?

1183
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:05,261
Is there anything l can get you?

1184
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:08,514
No, not unless you can
bring those spiders back to life.

1185
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,224
Spiders?

1186
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:12,435
The ones that they destroyed...

1187
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:16,772
..."to restore investor confidence."

1188
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:19,984
Go home, Felicia.

1189
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,527
Take the day off.

1190
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:24,905
Harry.

1191
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:30,828
I think there may be another way
to get what you're looking for.

1192
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:37,460
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security heads.

1193
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:40,337
Before they destroyed the spiders...

1194
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:42,923
...they had the venom extracted.

1195
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:46,719
What?

1196
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,431
What are you saying?

1197
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,516
That way, they could comply
with the lawsuits...

1198
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:55,603
...but still keep the data
in case it ever became useful.

1199
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:57,980
Where is it?

1200
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:00,149
It's somewhere in the building.

1201
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:05,196
It's somewhere off-books
called "Special Projects."

1202
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:09,033
Special Projects.

1203
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,701
Most recent entry:

1204
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,244
One hour ago.

1205
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:15,164
"Approved by Harry Osborn."

1206
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:20,336
Accessing Ravencroft Archive.

1207
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:27,259
File 71 3.

1208
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:31,138
What the hell?

1209
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,141
File 71 .

1210
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,602
Subject: Dillon, Max.

1211
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:38,354
And then l'm gonna kill the light...

1212
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:42,691
...so everyone in this city is gonna
know how it feels to live in my world.

1213
01:28:42,943 --> 01:28:44,902
A world without power.

1214
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,362
A world...

1215
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:48,280
...without Spider-Man.

1216
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:49,949

He's busy.

1219
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:57,540
What did you do?

1220
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:00,209
The more relevant question is
what did you do?

1221
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:04,505
An employee is killed and in your
first action as CEO, you cover it up.

1222
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:09,134
No, you covered it up. Then you buried
him in the bughouse using my name.

1223
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:13,180
Ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement.

1224
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:15,349
You are experimenting
on people in there.

1225
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,768
Progress has its stepping stones.

1226
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,813
Now, in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you've been--

1227
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:22,648
How do l put this gently?

1228
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:23,899
--fired.

1229
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:27,278
You are not going to bury me too.

1230
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:30,197
Looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

1231
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:32,616
It's only a matter of time.

1232
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,536
You're going to die a horrible death.

1233
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,538
Like your father.

1234
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,748
The difference is...

1235
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,084
...no one is going to miss you.

1236
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,130
Get him out.

1237
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,381
Wait. Wait.

1238
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,390
I know my way out.

1239
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,652
A hundred dollars.
Can you believe that?

1240
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:11,071
Tell you why, you should
put the lid on that but quick.

1241
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:12,656
I tried. Good luck.

1242
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:15,701
You should tell her to come down here
and find one of those alligators.

1243
01:32:39,929 --> 01:32:41,138
Test.

1244
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:43,474
My name is Richard Parker.

1245
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:45,809
Whatever lies will be told about me...

1246
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:47,936
...l would like the world
to know the truth.

1247
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:52,149
Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research...

1248
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:57,237
...when Norman Osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organisation...

1249
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,990
...to continue funding my research.

1250
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,618
And l discovered what
they were going to use it for.

1251
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:05,412
Weapons. Biological weapons,
of course.

1252
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:06,997
So l refused.

1253
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:10,375
And now, to eliminate me
from the picture...

1254
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:14,505
...Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me...

1255
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:18,258
...in order to take control
of my work.

1256
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:23,013
Can l help you?

1257
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:25,557
Yeah, you can open the gate.

1258
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:27,101
I'm Harry Osborn.

1259
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:31,355
Now, there's a patient in that
Isolation Wing that l need to see.

1260
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:34,483
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.

1261
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:37,319
Sorry, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.

1262
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:43,450
But it doesn't matter
because there's something else...

1263
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:46,286
...that Norman doesn't know.

1264
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:49,498
The human DNA...

1265
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:52,626
...that l implanted in the spiders...

1266
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:55,629
...was my own.

1267
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,425
Which means that without me...

1268
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:02,344
...without my bloodline...

1269
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:07,224
...Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.

1270
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:10,018
Keep Electro incubated...

1271
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:14,439
...with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental und phenobarbital.

1272
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:20,404
l have destroyed as much as possible
from the archives.

1273
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:22,614
But l didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.

1274
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:26,076
So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.

1275
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:30,122
l have to disappear. l have to get
as far away from here as l can.

1276
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:32,166
But as a father...

1277
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:35,669
...it means l may not
see my boy again.

1278
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,007
And nothing is as important to me...

1279
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,759
...as my son, Peter.

1280
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:44,887
Nothing in this world.

1281
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:47,472
But I have a responsibility...

1282
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:49,766
...to protect the world
from what l've created...

1283
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:52,978
...and to protect him from
what l know Osborn is capable of.

1284
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:56,231
People will say l am a monster...

1285
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:58,817
...for what l've done.

1286
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,029
And maybe they're right.

1287
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:06,909
l always thought that l'd have more...

1288
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,243
...time.

1289
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:10,370
Dad? Dad!

1290
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:11,914
l'm sorry.

1291
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,434
Sedation off.

1292
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:41,360
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1293
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,779
All right?
But we don't have much time.

1294
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:45,697
Who are you?

1295
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:49,076
I'm Harry Osborn.
I wanna make you a deal.

1296
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,120
I should kill you.

1297
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:54,081
Oh, come on.

1298
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,500
Think bigger, Max.

1299
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,752
I'm not the one you want.

1300
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:00,295
You want Spider-Man.

1301
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:03,632
And I can give him to you.

1302
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:08,553
But l need something first.

1303
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:12,140
I need you to get me into Oscorp.

1304
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,017
Get you in?

1305
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:15,936
You own it.

1306
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,188
Not anymore.

1307
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:19,690
Oscorp betrayed us both...

1308
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:23,777
...so l can't get in there without you
and you can't get out of here without me.

1309
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:27,322
-What's happening?
-Someone pulled an alarm in the Iso Unit.

1310
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:30,117
Get a containment team up there now.

1311
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:32,494
You couldn't possibly know
what I want.

1312
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,454
You submitted the design for the grid...

1313
01:36:34,706 --> 01:36:36,581
...and they stole it.
And now you want it back.

1314
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,625
You just wanna take back
what's yours.

1315
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:41,586
-How?
-It is all the power in the city, Max...

1316
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:43,755
...and it's right at your fingertips.

1317
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,799
And then once you shut down
the grid...

1318
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:49,970
...Spider-Man will come to you,
and I want you to make him bleed.

1319
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:52,973
Break it! Break it!

1320
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,644
Max, we don't have much time!

1321
01:36:57,895 --> 01:37:00,230
Go! Go, go! Go!

1322
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,524
Give me one reason
why l should trust you.

1323
01:37:02,775 --> 01:37:03,817
Because l need you!

1324
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:06,737
You need me?

1325
01:37:06,988 --> 01:37:09,906
Yes. l need you.

1326
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:14,286
You are my only chance
that I have at surviving.

1327
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:15,454
You need me?

1328
01:37:15,705 --> 01:37:17,622
Yes. l need you.

1329
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:19,875
I need you. Please! Please!

1330
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:22,794
Please!

1331
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:25,005
I know what it's like to be thrown away!

1332
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:26,256
Please, Max!

1333
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:28,425
I need you! I need you!

1334
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:19,851
No!

1335
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,524
You wanna be my friend?

1336
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:28,360
I thought we were already friends.

1337
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:31,405
I had a friend once.

1338
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,241
It didn't work out.

1339
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,451
Yeah. Me too.

1340
01:38:37,954 --> 01:38:40,038
Then let's go catch a spider.

1341
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:45,961
You have one new voice message.

1342
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:50,048
Hi, Peter, it's me.

1343
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:54,970
l got in to Oxford.

1344
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:59,057
lt's very exciting.

1345
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:02,894
l came by your house a little bit ago
and l....

1346
01:39:03,521 --> 01:39:04,563
You weren't there...

1347
01:39:04,814 --> 01:39:08,191
...and so l'm on my way
to the airport right now...

1348
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:11,111
...because there's this early
summer class that l found out about...

1349
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:14,448
...and l thought that
it would somehow...

1350
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:18,827
...be easier, l guess, this way.

1351
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:22,831
l think that maybe it's time...

1352
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:25,250
...to let this go.

1353
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:28,211
And that's not because
l don't love you.

1354
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:31,756
lt's actually because l do, so....

1355
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:33,758
Okay, bye.

1356
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:50,692
-We have to move, now.
-Why? What's happened?

1357
01:40:03,623 --> 01:40:05,248
Remember me?

1358
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:10,962
Oh, my, oh, my.

1359
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:13,173
How the tables have turned.

1360
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:16,134
I know it's hard to admit...

1361
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:20,722
...but how spectacular a move is this?

1362
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:24,559
-Am l right?
-Right as rain.

1363
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:28,813
Okay, so, Fairy Godmother...

1364
01:40:29,065 --> 01:40:31,858
...it is time to grant me a wish.

1365
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:36,321
-I want in to Special--
-How dare you come back in here?

1366
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:40,992
You recalcitrant, unworthy, defective...

1367
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:43,203
...urchin freaks.

1368
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:50,961
Oh, God, l'm sorry. That's just not
the answer we were looking for.

1369
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,642
Clear.

1370
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,021
Welcome back to the bonus round.

1371
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:14,943
Hey, let's take a walk, shall we?

1372
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:22,117
The grid is all yours.

1373
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:56,818
The spider venom. Give it to me.

1374
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:04,242
What is all this stuff?

1375
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:05,994
The future.

1376
01:42:19,759 --> 01:42:20,967
Load one up.

1377
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,806
It won't work.

1378
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:30,727
We ran every diagnostic test
apart from human trials.

1379
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:34,939
You've actually already run human
trials. You're just too stupid to know it.

1380
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:41,029
Do it. Now.

1381
01:43:00,675 --> 01:43:28,201
You had it all this time.

1382
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:33,767
It's Spider-Man.

1383
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:40,857
Stop the cab.

1384
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:43,151
Lady, l ain't even moving.

1385
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:15,308
-Hi.
-Hi.

1386
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:17,769
-Did you get my message?
-What message?

1387
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,688
-The message right there.
-Oh, that. That was you?

1388
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,732
-Don't do that.
-I couldn't make it out.

1389
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:25,109
I'll tell you what it says.
Says, "I love you."

1390
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:28,488
Because l love you.

1391
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:31,950
-And no offence, but you're wrong.
-I'm wrong about what?

1392
01:45:32,201 --> 01:45:34,035
You're wrong about
us being on different paths.

1393
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:36,621
We're not on different paths.
You're my path.

1394
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:39,874
And you're always gonna be my path.

1395
01:45:40,835 --> 01:45:44,379
And I know there's a million reasons why
we shouldn't be together. I know that.

1396
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:46,381
But l'm tired of them.

1397
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:51,302
I'm tired of every single one of them.

1398
01:45:51,804 --> 01:45:53,721
We've all gotta make a choice.

1399
01:45:55,641 --> 01:45:57,100
Right? Well, l choose you.

1400
01:45:59,728 --> 01:46:00,979
So...

1401
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:02,772
...here's my thought.

1402
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,733
England.

1403
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:08,403
Both of us.

1404
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:11,865
I'm following you now.

1405
01:46:12,408 --> 01:46:14,242
I'm just gonna follow you everywhere.

1406
01:46:14,827 --> 01:46:16,786
I'm just gonna follow you
the rest of my life.

1407
01:46:17,955 --> 01:46:21,165
I mean, they got crime there
in England.

1408
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:23,084
-Yeah.
-They got tons of crime, it seems.

1409
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:25,253
-Tons.
-They got...

1410
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:27,463
...Jack the Ripper.

1411
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:29,299
What?

1412
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:32,093
They haven't caught Jack the Ripper
yet. You didn't know that?

1413
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:53,323
What the hell is that?

1414
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:05,501
Is that Max?

1415
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:08,338
He must have cut the power
to the whole city.

1416
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:18,640
PNA 322, you are--

1417
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:21,059
-I'm black.
-I have nothing.

1418
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:23,645
Hey, I need Tech Ops up here
right now.

1419
01:47:23,896 --> 01:47:26,397
The phones are down. Somebody
go down and grab Tech Ops.

1420
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:28,566
Hey, write down
what you remember, people.

1421
01:47:28,817 --> 01:47:32,570
There's gotta be some kind of blackout
plan, right? Some kind of backup?

1422
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:35,657
There's an emergency reset
at the power plant.

1423
01:47:35,908 --> 01:47:38,743
If he cuts the transmission lines,
they're never gonna get this back up.

1424
01:47:38,994 --> 01:47:41,663
How will l stop him? Every time
I get close, he fries my web shooters.

1425
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:43,873
-Have you tried grounding them?
-Tried everything.

1426
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:46,167
-Rubber, plastic--
-Did you try magnetizing them?

1427
01:47:46,418 --> 01:47:48,878
I didn't try magnetizing them.

1428
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:51,297
Okay, well, remember
8th grade science class?

1429
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:54,592
If you magnetize a nail with a battery....

1430
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:56,886
-It holds an electric charge.
-Yes.

1431
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:02,475
New York Approach.
This is Pan National 273 on approach.

1432
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:04,018
How do you hear?

1433
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:06,354
Approach, do you copy?

1434
01:48:06,605 --> 01:48:08,564
Radio's working. lt's not us.

1435
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:20,159
Do not panic. Everyone,
please return to your vehicles.

1436
01:48:20,411 --> 01:48:22,286
Go back to your cars.

1437
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:23,955
Remain calm.

1438
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:28,001
Do not panic.
Everyone return to your vehicles.

1439
01:48:28,252 --> 01:48:29,711
-Go into your homes.
-Officer!

1440
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:31,254
Spider-Man!

1441
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:33,756
My father was Captain George Stacy
of the 1 9th Precinct.

1442
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:36,759
-I knew who he was. What can we do?
-Jumper cables.

1443
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:39,137
-Jumper cables?
-Yes. And copper wire.

1444
01:48:39,388 --> 01:48:41,806
Am l talking louder
than l usually talk right now?!

1445
01:48:42,558 --> 01:48:43,558
Yes.

1446
01:48:44,393 --> 01:48:46,102
-Your suit'll ground you.
-All right, do it.

1447
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:52,692
Okay, good. Try, try, try.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1448
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:53,943
Okay, it works, good.

1449
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,862
That is why you were number two
at Midtown.

1450
01:48:56,113 --> 01:48:56,904
Rub it in. Okay.

1451
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:00,950
-I gotta go.
-I'm coming with you.

1452
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:03,036
-You're not coming with me.
-Yes, l am.

1453
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:04,537
-It's too dangerous.
-I'm coming.

1454
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:07,206
I've seen the grid specs
and I know how to reset the system.

1455
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:11,419
-I'm coming with you! You need me!
-Okay, shut up. You're coming with me!

1456
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:12,920
Shut the thing.

1457
01:49:13,297 --> 01:49:15,048
Sorry. l love you. Don't hate me.

1458
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:18,176
Peter!

1459
01:49:18,427 --> 01:49:20,261
We still don't have backup generators.

1460
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,888
Get me Engineering!

1461
01:49:22,264 --> 01:49:23,431
I need a respirator right now.

1462
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:25,516
They're battery-operated. l'll get it.

1463
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:26,934
Hang on.

1464
01:49:27,686 --> 01:49:28,728
Okay.

1465
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:53,795
Do you see me now, Spider-Man?

1466
01:49:54,088 --> 01:49:57,340
lt's time to meet our destiny.

1467
01:50:12,481 --> 01:50:14,899
Tower, we're experiencing
some kind of electrical disturbance.

1468
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:17,652
Instruments are going haywire.
Radar is down.

1469
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,321
We're flying blind out here.
Do you copy?

1470
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:27,370
Tower, repeat: We are standby only.
What is happening?

1471
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:30,873
Sir? There are two inbound flights
on intersecting paths.

1472
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,834
-Time to impact?
-Four and a half minutes.

1473
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:34,210
Clock it right now.

1474
01:50:48,183 --> 01:50:50,351
You're too late, Spider-Man.

1475
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:52,353
I designed this power grid.

1476
01:50:52,604 --> 01:50:54,188
Now l'm gonna take back...

1477
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:56,149
...what is rightfully mine.

1478
01:50:56,525 --> 01:50:58,693
I will control everything.

1479
01:50:58,944 --> 01:51:02,572
And I will be like a god to them.

1480
01:51:02,823 --> 01:51:04,115
A god named Sparkles?

1481
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:15,751
Not this time.

1482
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:18,588
Is that all you got? Come on!

1483
01:51:37,691 --> 01:51:38,858
Come on!

1484
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:44,322
You ready to give up?

1485
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:57,460
Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy.

1486
01:52:08,138 --> 01:52:09,805
Just shake it off. lt's just your bones...

1487
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:12,183
...and your muscles and your organs.

1488
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:17,313
Oh, boy.

1489
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:25,696
I hate this song!

1490
01:52:46,677 --> 01:52:47,677
Spider-Man...

1491
01:52:48,095 --> 01:52:49,428
...bet you never saw this coming.

1492
01:52:57,104 --> 01:52:58,896
Really? You web me to a car?

1493
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:00,523
What are you, a caveman?

1494
01:53:00,774 --> 01:53:01,983
You shouldn't be here.

1495
01:53:02,234 --> 01:53:04,819
You tie me up to go off to war?
I know how to help you!

1496
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:07,196
-What are you doing here?!
-I know the grid specs.

1497
01:53:07,447 --> 01:53:08,739
I can reset the system!

1498
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:11,200
You can't be here right now.
I'm not messing around.

1499
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:13,160
You can't be here right now.
This is insane.

1500
01:53:13,412 --> 01:53:16,372
Nobody makes my decisions for me.
All right? Nobody.

1501
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:18,666
This is my choice, okay?

1502
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:21,794
My choice. This is mine.

1503
01:53:22,087 --> 01:53:23,337
Now, how do we stop him?

1504
01:53:23,588 --> 01:53:25,965
Okay, so he's electric,
he's like a battery.

1505
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:27,883
What happens
if you overcharge a battery?

1506
01:53:28,135 --> 01:53:29,135
-It explodes.
-Right.

1507
01:53:29,386 --> 01:53:30,970
So we use his power against him.
Perfect.

1508
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:33,055
-Okay.
-I think I can reconnect the power lines.

1509
01:53:33,307 --> 01:53:34,765
But l need you to reset the system.

1510
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:37,893
Okay, when l say you turn
that power on, you turn it on.

1511
01:53:38,145 --> 01:53:40,479
-No matter what. No matter what.
-Peter.

1512
01:53:45,485 --> 01:53:46,819
Go, go!

1513
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:40,915
Sixty seconds to impact.

1514
01:55:15,534 --> 01:55:16,534
Now, Gwen, now!

1515
01:55:16,785 --> 01:55:17,910
Do it now!

1516
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:44,687
Uni 687--

1517
01:55:55,824 --> 01:55:58,617
This is LaGuardia Tower.
Turn immediately to heading 280.

1518
01:56:00,036 --> 01:56:02,329
You have incoming traffic. I repeat: 280.

1519
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:03,873
Defend immediately.

1520
01:56:19,389 --> 01:56:20,389
Yes!

1521
01:56:21,016 --> 01:56:23,225
All right, people, back to work.
Let's land these planes.

1522
01:56:23,477 --> 01:56:24,852
I'll be back in a minute.

1523
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,646
Oh, thank God. All right!

1524
01:56:27,898 --> 01:56:29,940
All right, we're back.
Everyone, let's go.

1525
01:57:05,936 --> 01:57:07,728
I think we can still make your flight.

1526
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:17,696
Gwen, stay there.

1527
01:57:43,765 --> 01:57:45,182
Peter.

1528
01:57:46,101 --> 01:57:49,270
When you said Spider-Man said no...

1529
01:57:49,771 --> 01:57:53,816
...you meant you said no.

1530
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:56,485
Harry, what did you do?

1531
01:57:56,736 --> 01:57:58,737
What you made me do.

1532
01:57:59,281 --> 01:58:00,781
You were my friend...

1533
01:58:01,032 --> 01:58:03,576
...and you betrayed me!

1534
01:58:03,868 --> 01:58:04,994
No.

1535
01:58:05,453 --> 01:58:07,371
I was trying to protect you.

1536
01:58:08,123 --> 01:58:09,373
Look at me.

1537
01:58:09,624 --> 01:58:11,709
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
This is gonna be all right.

1538
01:58:12,127 --> 01:58:13,377
You don't give people hope.

1539
01:58:14,087 --> 01:58:15,629
You take it away.

1540
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:16,922
No, Harry.

1541
01:58:17,507 --> 01:58:19,466
I'm gonna take away yours.

1542
01:58:19,718 --> 01:58:20,968
No. Gwen, run!

1543
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:22,678
Harry!

1544
01:58:23,305 --> 01:58:24,638
Harry, put her down!

1545
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:43,365
Harry, stop this right now!

1546
01:58:43,617 --> 01:58:46,327
This isn't you, Harry. This is not you.
Harry, put her down.

1547
01:58:46,911 --> 01:58:48,829
-Harry.
-Harry is dead!

1548
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:52,041
Harry, this is between you and me.
You wanna fight?

1549
01:58:52,292 --> 01:58:54,335
Fight me! Let her go!

1550
01:58:54,878 --> 01:58:56,003
Okay.

1551
01:58:57,213 --> 01:58:57,838
No!

1552
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:07,348
You okay?

1553
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:14,980
I got you, Gwen. I'm gonna
put you down right here.

1554
02:00:35,228 --> 02:00:36,145
Peter?

1555
02:01:39,876 --> 02:01:42,085
Hey. Hey.

1556
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:46,381
Gwen?

1557
02:01:49,052 --> 02:01:50,052
Hey.

1558
02:01:50,428 --> 02:01:51,553
Hey!

1559
02:01:56,392 --> 02:01:57,476
Gwen?

1560
02:01:59,521 --> 02:02:00,521
Hey.

1561
02:02:04,067 --> 02:02:05,108
Breathe.

1562
02:02:06,653 --> 02:02:08,570
Hey, Gwen.

1563
02:02:09,572 --> 02:02:15,369
Hey.

1564
02:02:17,789 --> 02:02:19,081
You're okay.

1565
02:02:22,836 --> 02:02:23,919
Gwen?

1566
02:02:29,843 --> 02:02:31,343
Stay with me, stay with me.

1567
02:02:31,594 --> 02:02:33,971
Stay with me, stay with me.
You stay with me.

1568
02:02:39,727 --> 02:02:40,811
Gwen.

1569
02:02:43,523 --> 02:02:44,565
Gwen!

1570
02:02:47,569 --> 02:02:50,112
No, please, please.

1571
02:02:52,657 --> 02:02:54,032
Please.

1572
02:03:00,915 --> 02:03:03,166
I can't do this without you.

1573
02:05:05,832 --> 02:05:07,249
Leave us.

1574
02:05:11,546 --> 02:05:13,130
You've made progress.

1575
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:16,591
I've identified several
worthy candidates.

1576
02:05:16,843 --> 02:05:18,927
Now that Spider-Man's gone...

1577
02:05:19,178 --> 02:05:22,222
...this city will never be the same.

1578
02:05:22,473 --> 02:05:25,017
Oh, I'm counting on that.

1579
02:05:25,268 --> 02:05:26,852
Speaking of progress...

1580
02:05:27,103 --> 02:05:28,145
...you're looking better.

1581
02:05:29,105 --> 02:05:30,939
It comes and goes.

1582
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:34,109
Tell me more.

1583
02:05:34,694 --> 02:05:36,236
How many men did you have in mind?

1584
02:05:36,487 --> 02:05:38,488
I wanna keep it small.

1585
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:42,159
Everything you need
is already at Oscorp.

1586
02:05:44,037 --> 02:05:45,579
Access granted.

1587
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:47,748
Welcome, Mr. Fiers.

1588
02:05:48,041 --> 02:05:49,750
Who's our first volunteer?

1589
02:05:50,001 --> 02:05:51,793
Aleksei Sytsevich.

1590
02:05:52,045 --> 02:05:54,212
Currently serving a life sentence.

1591
02:05:54,464 --> 02:05:55,672
He is...

1592
02:05:55,923 --> 02:05:58,175
...most eager to join us.

1593
02:05:59,010 --> 02:06:00,302
Good.

1594
02:06:00,970 --> 02:06:02,971
Start with him.

1595
02:06:03,473 --> 02:06:05,015
Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich...

1596
02:06:05,266 --> 02:06:07,184
...was broken out of
a classified penitentiary...

1597
02:06:07,435 --> 02:06:10,604
...known simply as the Vault
by an unknown team of men.

1598
02:06:10,855 --> 02:06:13,273
lt's yet another example
of increased criminal activity...

1599
02:06:13,524 --> 02:06:16,693
...since the disappearance
of Spider-Man five months ago.

1600
02:06:16,944 --> 02:06:20,197
The web-slinger's absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city.

1601
02:06:20,448 --> 02:06:23,033
Believe it or not, even the New
York City Police Department...

1602
02:06:23,284 --> 02:06:25,285
...has joined the chorus
of New Yorkers in hoping...

1603
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:27,621
...for the return of the web-slinger.

1604
02:06:27,872 --> 02:06:30,040
The entire world seems to be
asking the same question:

1605
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:32,793
Where is Spider-Man?

1606
02:06:34,087 --> 02:06:36,505
Too bad about that spider guy.

1607
02:06:38,049 --> 02:06:40,926
Too bad he's disappeared.
Seems like everybody really needs him.

1608
02:06:42,929 --> 02:06:44,221
Where you going?

1609
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:48,100
-Eat my cereal.
-Peter.

1610
02:06:48,518 --> 02:06:50,185
Where you going?

1611
02:07:00,154 --> 02:07:01,196
I don't know.

1612
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:05,158
You know, it's so funny.
I've been--

1613
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:08,745
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organised...

1614
02:07:09,163 --> 02:07:13,375
...and been putting
some of Ben's stuff in boxes.

1615
02:07:14,168 --> 02:07:17,879
And it's so funny, the heavier
the box gets, the lighter I feel.

1616
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:20,674
-You're throwing his stuff away?
-No.

1617
02:07:20,925 --> 02:07:22,134
No. God, no.

1618
02:07:22,510 --> 02:07:25,637
I couldn't do that. lt's part of me.

1619
02:07:26,514 --> 02:07:29,474
I'm just finding...

1620
02:07:30,434 --> 02:07:31,893
...a better place for it.

1621
02:07:35,648 --> 02:07:37,566
I'm gonna take one last look...

1622
02:07:39,026 --> 02:07:40,652
...and I'm gonna put it
where it belongs.

1623
02:08:05,928 --> 02:08:10,140
lt's easy to feel hopeful
on a beautiful day like today.

1624
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:14,227
But there will be dark days
ahead of us too.

1625
02:08:15,062 --> 02:08:17,606
There will be days
where you feel all alone.

1626
02:08:20,151 --> 02:08:22,569
And that's when hope is needed most.

1627
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:26,072
No matter how buried it gets...

1628
02:08:26,908 --> 02:08:28,992
...or how lost you feel...

1629
02:08:29,243 --> 02:08:30,952
...you must promise me...

1630
02:08:31,204 --> 02:08:34,539
...that you will hold on to hope.

1631
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:37,500
Keep it alive.

1632
02:08:38,419 --> 02:08:41,046
We have to be greater
than what we suffer.

1633
02:08:41,297 --> 02:08:42,756
My wish for you...

1634
02:08:43,007 --> 02:08:45,133
...is to become hope.

1635
02:08:45,593 --> 02:08:47,052
People need that.

1636
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:50,347
And even if we fail...

1637
02:08:50,723 --> 02:08:52,766
...what better way is there to live?

1638
02:08:54,352 --> 02:08:56,102
As we look around here today...

1639
02:08:56,479 --> 02:08:59,689
...at all of the people
who helped make us who we are...

1640
02:09:00,399 --> 02:09:02,817
...l know it feels like
we're saying goodbye.

1641
02:09:03,361 --> 02:09:06,029
But we will carry
a piece of each other...

1642
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:09,032
...into everything that we do next...

1643
02:09:10,701 --> 02:09:13,703
...to remind us of who we are...

1644
02:09:15,581 --> 02:09:17,374
...and of who we're meant to be.

1645
02:09:19,669 --> 02:09:21,836
l've had a great four years with you.

1646
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:24,089
l'll miss you all very much.

1647
02:09:46,487 --> 02:09:47,570
Let's go! Move it.

1648
02:09:55,955 --> 02:09:57,414
Get down! Take cover!

1649
02:10:01,252 --> 02:10:05,547
l'm here live on Park Avenue and
56th Street where it is complete chaos.

1650
02:10:05,798 --> 02:10:08,008
A man in some sort of
weaponised armoured suit...

1651
02:10:08,259 --> 02:10:09,676
...is wreaking havoc on Midtown.

1652
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:16,349
I am the Rhino!

1653
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,019
I told you l would be back!

1654
02:10:30,281 --> 02:10:32,407
-No! No!
-A kid!

1655
02:10:37,621 --> 02:10:38,371
Hold your fire!

1656
02:10:38,998 --> 02:10:40,623
Everybody, hold your fire.

1657
02:10:41,459 --> 02:10:44,544
-Unit 2, stand down. Stand down.
-Civilian in our line of sight.

1658
02:10:48,507 --> 02:10:49,549
Kid! You gotta get--

1659
02:10:51,719 --> 02:10:53,511
Look, New York!

1660
02:10:53,763 --> 02:10:55,597
Spider-Man is back.

1661
02:10:56,182 --> 02:10:57,182
Leave the kid alone!

1662
02:10:57,433 --> 02:10:59,392
That's my baby! Please.

1663
02:11:02,438 --> 02:11:04,522
Brave boy.

1664
02:11:04,815 --> 02:11:07,150
Does Aleksei scare you, little boy?

1665
02:11:24,460 --> 02:11:25,960
Hey, Spider-Man.

1666
02:11:36,389 --> 02:11:37,680
I knew you'd come back.

1667
02:11:38,182 --> 02:11:40,517
Yeah. Thanks for stepping up for me.

1668
02:11:40,768 --> 02:11:42,852
You're the bravest kid l've ever seen.

1669
02:11:43,104 --> 02:11:45,814
I'm gonna take care of this jerk.
You go take care of your mom. Okay?

1670
02:11:46,065 --> 02:11:48,608
All right, get out of here. Go. Go.

1671
02:11:55,658 --> 02:11:56,825
You fight me?

1672
02:11:57,159 --> 02:11:59,202
You fight me now?

1673
02:12:00,246 --> 02:12:03,581
On behalf of the fine people of New
York City and real rhinos everywhere...

1674
02:12:03,833 --> 02:12:06,835
...I ask you to put
your mechanised paws in the air.

1675
02:12:07,086 --> 02:12:08,086
Never!

1676
02:12:08,337 --> 02:12:11,339
I crush you! I kill you! l destroy you!

1677
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:13,091
You want me to come down there
so you can kill me?

1678
02:12:13,384 --> 02:12:14,384
Yes!

1679
02:12:14,635 --> 02:12:15,844
I'll be right there.

1680
02:12:16,220 --> 02:14:51,416
There's no place like home.
