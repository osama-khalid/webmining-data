Morning, Flash.

16
00:04:10,313 --> 00:04:12,399
Good morning, Parker.

17
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:20,412
Hey. It's Peter, right?

18
00:04:21,993 --> 00:04:23,494
l really like your photos.

19
00:04:23,592 --> 00:04:25,219
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

20
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:26,263
Listen...

21
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,726
...are you busy Friday night?

22
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:35,953
Cool. Can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

23
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,992
You know, l really wanna frame
a good one...

24
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,155
...for his birthday.

25
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,357
That's really nice of you.
Wow, that's such a nice thought.

26
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,709
Yeah, l'll have a look at the old....

27
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,542
-The old schedule.
-Okay.

28
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,716
Parker.

29
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,874
-Yes, sir?
-You want to keep that skateboard?

30
00:04:50,948 --> 00:04:52,451
-Yeah.
-Keep it off the ground.

31
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:53,883
-Sure. Yeah.
-Wheels up.

32
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:55,115
Like that?

33
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,939
-That's it.
-Okay.

34
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:23,321
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

35
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:24,802
Eat it! Eat it!

36
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:27,450
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

37
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:29,925
Eat your vegetables, Gordon.
Come on!

38
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:31,446
Come on!

39
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:32,713
Hey, Parker, come on.

40
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:34,201
Get a picture of this.

41
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:37,475
No, l'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.

42
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,465
-Come on.
-Gordon, don't eat it.

43
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:40,587
Take the picture.

44
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:42,164
Put him down, Flash.

45
00:05:42,263 --> 00:05:43,849
Take the picture.

46
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,530
Put him down, Eugene!

47
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:50,678
Hey, man.

48
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:53,051
Come on!

49
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:53,850
Get up, Parker!

50
00:05:56,463 --> 00:05:57,130
Get up!

51
00:05:57,262 --> 00:05:58,890
Come on! Come on!

52
00:05:58,982 --> 00:05:59,650
Get up!

53
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,797
Still not taking the picture.

54
00:06:04,222 --> 00:06:05,557
Stay down, Parker!

55
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:07,483
Who wants one more?

56
00:06:07,582 --> 00:06:09,167
-One more!
-Flash!

57
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:10,957
Flash...

58
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,938
...we still on for after school today?

59
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:14,147
My house, 3:30?

60
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,471
l hope you did homework.

61
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,082
Last time, l was...

62
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:18,790
...disappointed in you.

63
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,986
-Okay, move.
-No, how about we go to class?

64
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:22,270
How about it?

65
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:26,483
Whatever.

66
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,375
l thought that was great
what you did.

67
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:54,253
lt was stupid...

68
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:55,936
...but it was great.

69
00:06:56,777 --> 00:06:57,736
You should go to...

70
00:06:57,855 --> 00:06:59,608
...the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

71
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:02,496
What's your name?

72
00:07:03,016 --> 00:07:04,101
You don't know my name?

73
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,211
No, l know your name.

74
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:08,004
l want to know
if you know your name.

75
00:07:09,614 --> 00:07:11,159
Peter.

76
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:14,308
-Parker. Peter Parker.
-Okay. Okay, good.

77
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,168
l'd still go to the nurse though.

78
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:24,505
You're Gwen, right?

79
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:25,824
Gwen Stacy.

80
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:27,761
All right.

81
00:07:28,894 --> 00:07:30,562
Hey.

82
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:31,571
l'm making...

83
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:33,403
...spaghetti and meatballs tonight.

84
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:36,146
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.

85
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:39,924
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

86
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:41,964
-Oh, my God.
-What's up?

87
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:43,595
What happened to your face?

88
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:46,069
l'm all right. Just-- l fell, skating.

89
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,710
lt's all right.

90
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:50,330
Ben Parker, don't you even...

91
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:53,372
...think about leaving
that filthy box in my kitchen.

92
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:54,454
My bowling trophies.

93
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:56,114
Oh, well, then, by all means...

94
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:57,712
...leave that box in my kitchen.

95
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,271
-What happened to you?
-He fell.

96
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,165
Why you kids ride those things,
l'll never know.

97
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,795
Because it's stupid and dangerous.

98
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,516
Remember when we were stupid?

99
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:06,611
No.

100
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:08,857
-Trust me, we were.
-All right. Good to know.

101
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:09,846
Where's the flood?

102
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:11,471
Follow me. l'll show you.

103
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:12,778
-You serious?
-Yes.

104
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,495
All right.

105
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,205
It's the condenser tray.

106
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:20,895
Too much water for the condenser tray
or the heat exchange tubing.

107
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:22,847
This has got to be the fill line.

108
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:25,305
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

109
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:26,703
Can you fix it?

110
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,044
No, not tonight.
l'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.

111
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:32,507
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

112
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:36,037
How's the other guy look?

113
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:40,615
Come on.
l know a right cross when l see one.

114
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:44,402
Yes or no?
Do l have to call somebody's father?

115
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:45,723
No, no.

116
00:08:45,846 --> 00:08:46,930
All right.

117
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:49,131
Well, l wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

118
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:52,483
l pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.

119
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:55,549
Before you come up, see if...

120
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:58,063
-...there's anything else worth saving.
-Okay.

121
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,409
-Plumbers don't fix appliances.
-Yes, they do.

122
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:18,067
They fix pipes and pump things.

123
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:19,997
lf you ask them to--

124
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,712
l forgot all about that thing.

125
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:27,637
lt was your dad's.

126
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:29,596
-Yeah.
-He asked us to keep it safe.

127
00:09:33,401 --> 00:09:36,779
He saw it in the window of that
Ieather shop over on 9th Avenue.

128
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:40,449
He was 1 9. What does a 1 9-year-old kid
need with a briefcase?

129
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,263
And guess who sold it to him.

130
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,028
-l don't know.
-Your mother.

131
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,204
That's how they met.

132
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:47,076
He asked you to...

133
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:49,160
...keep this safe?
There's nothing in here.

134
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,991
Have you looked?
There's nothing here.

135
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:53,206
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.

136
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:55,739
Yeah, l know.

137
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:02,438
Who's that?

138
00:10:02,556 --> 00:10:04,101
Do you know who that is?

139
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:05,532
Some guy who worked with...

140
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,764
...your dad, l guess.

141
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:13,316
Just take this off the table, all right?

142
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:16,441
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.

143
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:18,353
-Now.
-All right.

144
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:19,438
Go on.

145
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,171
I need you to be a good boy.

146
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:56,398
Where are you going?

147
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:57,680
There's something...

148
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,795
...your mom and l have to do.

149
00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:55,759
What is this?

150
00:11:58,506 --> 00:12:00,717
''Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm.''

151
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:04,938
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

152
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:14,338
Come in.

153
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:15,739
You okay?

154
00:12:15,864 --> 00:12:18,200
-Yeah. What's up?
-Oh, my God.

155
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:19,557
You look just like him.

156
00:12:20,344 --> 00:12:22,429
-Can l come in?
-Yeah.

157
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,502
Listen...

158
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,042
...l don't have much education.

159
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:31,603
You know that, Peter.

160
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:35,361
Hell, l stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 1 O.

161
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:37,963
What l'm trying to say is...

162
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,760
...l know it's been rough
for you without your dad.

163
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:42,978
And l know we don't talk
much about them.

164
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:44,981
-Yeah, it's all right.
-No, it is not...

165
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,438
...all right.

166
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:50,010
l wish l could change it, but l can't.

167
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:53,077
Curt Connors.

168
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,415
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

169
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,796
They worked together for years
and they were close.

170
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,237
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

171
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,241
He never even called.

172
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:04,549
Not once.

173
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:08,526
Go figure.

174
00:13:12,178 --> 00:13:12,888
She's pretty.

175
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:19,101
Uncle Ben.

176
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:20,469
What?

177
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:22,479
You're a pretty great dad.

178
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:17,465
Excuse me.

179
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:18,364
What?

180
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:20,077
Can l help you?

181
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:21,840
l don't know. l'm here to see...

182
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,391
-...Dr. Connors.
-Right.

183
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:25,369
You'll find yourself to the left.

184
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,803
You are here for the internship?

185
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,944
Yeah. Yeah.

186
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,135
Okay.

187
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,128
You'll find your badge to the left.

188
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:40,703
Having trouble finding yourself?

189
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:42,287
No. Yeah, l got it.

190
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:45,480
Okay...

191
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,486
...Mr. Guevara.

192
00:14:50,408 --> 00:14:52,536
Welcome to Oscorp.

193
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:55,445
Born from the mind of our founder,
Norman Osborn...

194
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:59,159
...the Oscorp Tower houses
1 08 fIoors of innovation.

195
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:04,134
Our scientific minds are pushing the
boundaries of defence, biomedicaI...

196
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:06,922
...and chemicaI technoIogies.
The future Iies within.

197
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,252
Welcome to Oscorp.

198
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,660
l'm Gwen Stacy, a senior...

199
00:15:09,765 --> 00:15:10,642
...at Midtown Science...

200
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:12,185
...and head intern to Dr. Connors.

201
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:14,455
l'll be with you
for the duration of your visit.

202
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:16,179
Where l go, you go.

203
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:17,996
That's the rule. Remember that...

204
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:19,546
-...all will be fine.
-Come on!

205
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:21,022
-lf you forget that--
-Listen!

206
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,043
Look, listen.

207
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:23,751
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here.

208
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:24,930
Just tell them...

209
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:26,088
...Rodrigo Guevara is here!

210
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:27,372
My name's Rodrigo!

211
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:30,321
l guess l don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget.

212
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:31,712
Shall we?

213
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:40,990
Come around this way.

214
00:15:44,963 --> 00:15:46,131
Good afternoon, Gwen.

215
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:47,203
Dr. Connors.

216
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:49,038
Welcome.

217
00:15:49,162 --> 00:15:51,958
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

218
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,255
Yes, in case you're wondering,
l'm a southpaw.

219
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:55,574
l'm not a cripple...

220
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:59,018
...l'm a scientist, and the world's
foremost authority on herpetology.

221
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,795
That's reptiles,
for those of you who don't know.

222
00:16:01,842 --> 00:16:03,302
Like the Parkinson's patient...

223
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,112
...who watches on in horror
as her body...

224
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,581
...slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration...

225
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:13,438
...whose eyes grow dimmer each day,
l long to fix myself.

226
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,277
l want to create a world
without weakness.

227
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,241
Anyone care to venture a guess
just how?

228
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,476
Yes.

229
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,559
Stem cells?

230
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,265
Promising. But the solution...

231
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,154
...l'm thinking of is more radical.

232
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,782
-No one?
-Cross-species genetics.

233
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:39,847
Person gets Parkinson's...

234
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,335
...when the brain cells
that produce dopamine...

235
00:16:42,396 --> 00:16:44,399
...start to disappear.

236
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:46,145
But a zebra fish has the ability...

237
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:48,448
...to regenerate cells on command.

238
00:16:48,796 --> 00:16:50,423
lf you could give this ability...

239
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:53,395
...to the woman you're talking about,
that's that. She's....

240
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:55,611
She's curing herself.

241
00:16:56,035 --> 00:16:58,580
Yeah, you iust have to look past
the gills on her neck.

242
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:03,084
And you are...?

243
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:06,992
He's one of Midtown Science's...

244
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:08,577
-...best and brightest.
-Really?

245
00:17:08,673 --> 00:17:09,675
Second in his class.

246
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:12,550
-Second?
-Yeah.

247
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:13,469
Sure about that?

248
00:17:13,595 --> 00:17:15,054
l'm pretty sure.

249
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:22,233
l'm afraid duty calls. l'll leave you in the
more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

250
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:24,103
Nice meeting you all.

251
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:28,534
lf you'd like to gather round.

252
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,635
Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.

253
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:34,105
Our pIanet's tree of Iife is immense.

254
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:35,677
At Oscorp's...

255
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,502
-...Cross-Species Division...
-Hi.

256
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:40,595
...we endeavour to explore
exciting new methods....

257
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:43,041
What are you doing, ''Rodrigo''?

258
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,160
Oh, yeah.

259
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:48,522
What are you doing here?

260
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,799
l work here. l don't.

261
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,496
l was gonna say l work here...

262
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,802
...but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that l don't.

263
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,706
You following me?

264
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,958
No, l'm not following you, no.
l had no idea you worked here.

265
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,199
Why would you be here?

266
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,145
l just snuck in because....

267
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:03,647
l love science.

268
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,542
-You love it.
-l'm passionate about it.

269
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:07,256
So you snuck in--?

270
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:09,517
-l have to lead this tour group.
-l know.

271
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,508
l'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.

272
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,801
-l promise you l won't.
-Stay with the group.

273
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:18,810
All right, guys? l'm gonna take you
to the bioreactor room now.

274
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:23,809
Sorry. Yo.

275
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:26,192
Sorry.

276
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:47,282
We received the results from
the mRNA sequences this morning.

277
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:50,087
They were disappointing.

278
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:56,659
Define ''disappointing.''

279
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:58,106
Another dead end.

280
00:20:58,212 --> 00:20:59,880
lt's the decay rate algorithm.

281
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:02,461
-And this is to be expected.
-Expected?

282
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:03,866
You said you were close.

283
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,140
We are close,
but it's gonna take time.

284
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,420
He doesn't have time.

285
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:09,825
Norman Osborn is dying,
Dr. Connors.

286
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,501
Save him.

287
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,525
Or we'll both lose our heads.

288
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:34,548
All right, give me the badge.

289
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:37,942
Give it to me.

290
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:42,783
Sorry.

291
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,499
Disgusting. Now l smell like beer.

292
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,089
l didn't mean to do that.

293
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,618
l didn't mean to....

294
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,472
l didn't-- l didn't--

295
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:51,848
Get your hand off her!

296
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,629
l'm trying to get my....

297
00:22:57,078 --> 00:22:57,997
Are you kidding?

298
00:22:58,118 --> 00:22:58,912
l'm sorry.

299
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,248
Are you kidding me?

300
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:02,469
-Hey, get him, Rudy!
-Hey!

301
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:06,726
Man, l'm sorry!

302
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:07,923
Man, are you all right?

303
00:23:10,677 --> 00:23:12,221
-Take him down!
-Come on.

304
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:16,256
Get him, man! Get him!

305
00:23:18,876 --> 00:23:20,128
No, man, no. Not my board.

306
00:23:20,237 --> 00:23:21,530
Please, dude, don't--

307
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:24,401
Sorry!

308
00:23:27,037 --> 00:23:29,205
Sorry. Sorry.

309
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:30,569
l'm so sorry.

310
00:23:34,354 --> 00:23:36,858
Coney Island, next stop.

311
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,876
Next and final stop, Coney Island.

312
00:23:50,314 --> 00:23:50,981
Hey.

313
00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:53,409
Hey. Hey.

314
00:23:53,514 --> 00:23:54,723
Sorry. l'm late.

315
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,502
-l got--
-We've been so worried.

316
00:23:56,592 --> 00:23:57,719
l know. l'm sorry.

317
00:23:57,832 --> 00:23:59,168
Watch out!

318
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:07,082
That's a fly, Peter.

319
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,577
Yeah.

320
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,759
l'm so sorry...

321
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:20,040
...l kept you guys up.

322
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,488
l'm insensitive, l'm irresponsible...

323
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:25,288
...and l'm hungry.

324
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,139
Meat loaf.

325
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,719
Drinking?

326
00:24:34,828 --> 00:24:35,872
What's this?

327
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,366
l don't think so.

328
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:39,137
This is your meat loaf.

329
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:43,233
This beats all other meat loafs.

330
00:24:44,388 --> 00:24:46,391
Something is very wrong.

331
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:47,956
Yeah.

332
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:50,112
Nobody likes your meat loaf.

333
00:24:55,947 --> 00:24:57,449
l got it.

334
00:25:00,747 --> 00:25:03,083
He took the frozen
macaroni and cheese.

335
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:04,960
l noticed that.

336
00:25:05,946 --> 00:25:08,657
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like my meat loaf?

337
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:10,996
You could have said that to me
37 years ago.

338
00:25:11,065 --> 00:25:13,735
How many meat loafs
have l made for you?

339
00:27:57,769 --> 00:27:58,519
Peter.

340
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:00,935
What are you doing?

341
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:02,550
l'm....

342
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:04,528
Homework.

343
00:28:04,647 --> 00:28:06,192
Be careful.

344
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:07,873
Sure.

345
00:28:16,606 --> 00:28:18,067
Dr. Connors.

346
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:21,420
You don't remember me. l--

347
00:28:21,526 --> 00:28:22,778
The intern from the other day.

348
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:24,955
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

349
00:28:25,046 --> 00:28:27,341
l'm sure you're very nice,
but this is a home.

350
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:29,742
l ask you to make an appointment
with my office.

351
00:28:29,805 --> 00:28:31,182
l'm Richard Parker's son.

352
00:28:38,165 --> 00:28:39,291
Peter?

353
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:42,432
l'm afraid...

354
00:28:42,564 --> 00:28:45,860
...l can't help you much. l don't know
why they left or where they...

355
00:28:45,883 --> 00:28:46,635
...were going.

356
00:28:49,284 --> 00:28:50,744
Good reflexes.

357
00:28:50,843 --> 00:28:52,220
Thank you.

358
00:28:56,963 --> 00:28:59,048
-Thank you.
-l read your book.

359
00:28:59,122 --> 00:29:00,583
Yeah.

360
00:29:00,683 --> 00:29:01,851
lt's something, you know.

361
00:29:01,963 --> 00:29:03,756
So you really think...

362
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,554
-...it's possible, cross-species genetics?
-Yes, of course.

363
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:09,063
Your father and l
were mocked for our theories.

364
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:11,875
Not iust in the community at large,
but at Oscorp, as well.

365
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:14,049
They called us mad scientists.

366
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,422
And then your father
bred the spiders...

367
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:18,858
...and everything changed.

368
00:29:18,961 --> 00:29:20,629
The results were
beyond encouraging.

369
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:22,681
They were spectacular.

370
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,646
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.

371
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,640
lncluding my own.

372
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,625
Then it was over.

373
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,319
He was gone.

374
00:29:35,878 --> 00:29:37,840
Took his research with him.

375
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:41,385
And l knew without him, l....

376
00:29:48,397 --> 00:29:50,150
l....

377
00:29:51,597 --> 00:29:53,766
l was angry.

378
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:57,819
So l stayed away from you...

379
00:29:57,917 --> 00:29:59,835
...and your family.

380
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:01,836
And for that, l'm truly sorry.

381
00:30:09,795 --> 00:30:11,423
Say....

382
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:13,081
Say it worked.

383
00:30:13,195 --> 00:30:15,364
Say you got it to work.

384
00:30:15,756 --> 00:30:19,718
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

385
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:22,564
What could the side effects be?

386
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:29,124
lt's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

387
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:30,768
The problem was always--

388
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,291
The decay rate algorithm?

389
00:30:35,032 --> 00:30:36,576
-Right.
-Right.

390
00:30:37,872 --> 00:30:38,999
Can l...?

391
00:30:39,112 --> 00:30:40,782
Of course.

392
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:03,645
Extraordinary.

393
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,024
How did you come up with this?

394
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:14,973
Peter, how about coming
to see me at the Tower...

395
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:16,948
-...one day after school?
-Yeah.

396
00:31:19,068 --> 00:31:20,737
Thank you.

397
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:41,459
Number one, Reggie.

398
00:31:41,586 --> 00:31:42,504
Run it, buddy.

399
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,169
Let's go, Reggie.

400
00:31:47,384 --> 00:31:48,136
Rejected!

401
00:31:50,665 --> 00:31:52,376
You did that on purpose, Flash!

402
00:31:52,465 --> 00:31:54,551
l should've.
You better watch your back.

403
00:31:58,265 --> 00:31:59,933
Hey.

404
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:02,624
All right?

405
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:09,856
Give it up.

406
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:16,188
Come on, man.

407
00:32:17,982 --> 00:32:18,983
One sec.

408
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:24,603
-Come on, man.
-Why don't you take it from me?

409
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,751
That's right. Take it.

410
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:31,472
Go ahead. Take it.

411
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:52,374
Just take it.

412
00:32:54,618 --> 00:32:56,788
All right, how about this?

413
00:32:57,499 --> 00:32:58,500
All right?

414
00:32:58,618 --> 00:32:59,537
How about that?

415
00:33:03,577 --> 00:33:05,705
-Come on, Flash.
-Flash, stop playing, man.

416
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:07,905
-Take it from him!
-Come on, Flash. Take it.

417
00:33:07,978 --> 00:33:09,312
Yo, Flash, let's go.

418
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:10,919
-Let's go!
-Do it, Flash.

419
00:33:11,017 --> 00:33:12,769
-Stop playing, man.
-Let's go, Flash.

420
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:14,526
-What are you doing?
-What's up?

421
00:33:16,137 --> 00:33:16,930
What you doing?

422
00:33:19,776 --> 00:33:21,904
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!

423
00:33:34,774 --> 00:33:36,444
Peter's behaviour is just...

424
00:33:36,534 --> 00:33:37,327
...unacceptable.

425
00:33:37,455 --> 00:33:38,331
They won't make us pay...

426
00:33:38,455 --> 00:33:41,291
-...for the backboard.
-l don't care about the backboard.

427
00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:43,045
-Was that true?
-What?

428
00:33:43,134 --> 00:33:44,928
What l heard in there just now.

429
00:33:45,013 --> 00:33:47,975
Did you humiliate that boy?

430
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:49,862
Yeah, l did.

431
00:33:50,934 --> 00:33:51,935
-But--
-But what?

432
00:33:52,052 --> 00:33:53,513
-This guy deserved it.
-Did he?

433
00:33:53,612 --> 00:33:55,323
-Yeah.
-ls he the kid that hit you?

434
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,744
ls he?

435
00:33:58,852 --> 00:34:00,688
Yeah, yeah, but....

436
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,858
So all this is about getting even.

437
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:06,755
lf so, l guess you must feel pretty good
about yourself now, right?

438
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:07,773
Am l right or wrong?

439
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:11,236
Yeah, l thought so.

440
00:34:11,771 --> 00:34:14,107
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours...

441
00:34:14,171 --> 00:34:16,131
...l had to change shifts at work...

442
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,881
...so you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:OO. Understood?

443
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:21,669
-ls that understood?
-Yeah.

444
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,480
Okay, good.

445
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:26,776
She looks familiar.

446
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,630
The girl on your computer.

447
00:34:31,209 --> 00:34:32,377
Yeah.

448
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,451
He's got you on his computer.
l'm his probation officer.

449
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:37,719
Don't forget Aunt May.

450
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:42,999
Okay.

451
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:48,368
He's a character.

452
00:34:48,446 --> 00:34:49,448
That's my uncle.

453
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:51,611
He's a pathological liar.

454
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:53,064
He thought you were someone else.

455
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:55,669
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?

456
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,855
l took a photo of the debate team,
and you're in the debate team.

457
00:34:58,885 --> 00:35:00,596
-Right.
-So...

458
00:35:00,686 --> 00:35:03,022
...he must have seen--
l was touching up stuff.

459
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,227
-Touching up stuff?
-Come on.

460
00:35:05,805 --> 00:35:07,974
l was.... l'm not gonna answer that.

461
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:12,386
-Did you get expelled?
-No, no.

462
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,656
l didn't get expelled.
l got community service.

463
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:20,687
So you want to-- l don't know...?

464
00:35:22,005 --> 00:35:22,797
Want to what?

465
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:24,614
l don't know.

466
00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:26,434
Just....

467
00:35:31,402 --> 00:35:33,864
l don't know-- We could....

468
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:36,681
We could do something else,
or we could--

469
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:39,224
-lf you don't feel like, we could--
-Yeah.

470
00:35:39,282 --> 00:35:40,826
-Yeah?
-Yeah, either one.

471
00:35:42,122 --> 00:35:44,249
-Really?
-Sure.

472
00:35:45,002 --> 00:35:45,836
Okay.

473
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:47,297
All right, good. Sounds good.

474
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,361
Cool.

475
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:50,343
Okay.

476
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,775
-l can't right now, l can't right now.
-Yeah, no.

477
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,010
-l'm so busy right now.
-l know, me too.

478
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,996
But maybe....

479
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,209
-Yeah, iust, you know....
-Some other....

480
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,948
-Time, all right.
-Okay.

481
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,708
-Bye.
-All right.

482
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:32,661
We have protein structure, rDNA...

483
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,796
...chromatography,
transgenics testing...

484
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:38,124
...that's X-ray video. That's the only
one on the planet. We have....

485
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,933
-Human line testing over--
-l remember that.

486
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,658
l've seen that before.

487
00:37:42,749 --> 00:37:44,043
The Ganali device.

488
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,861
Yeah, l remember a picture of that
in my dad's office.

489
00:37:46,908 --> 00:37:49,411
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

490
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:52,931
lt creates a cloud which can be dispersed
over a neighbourhood, even a city.

491
00:37:52,948 --> 00:37:56,327
Theoretically, you could
cure polio in an afternoon.

492
00:37:56,788 --> 00:37:58,332
That's incredible.

493
00:37:58,427 --> 00:38:01,681
Well, others disagreed. What if
the device were loaded with a toxin?

494
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,710
What if you wanted to opt out?
You can't...

495
00:38:03,787 --> 00:38:07,208
...run away from a cloud after all,
so here it lies, gathering dust.

496
00:38:07,906 --> 00:38:10,493
What you see here
is a computer model of a lizard.

497
00:38:10,547 --> 00:38:13,758
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted...

498
00:38:13,786 --> 00:38:16,290
...that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

499
00:38:16,345 --> 00:38:18,182
You can imagine my envy.

500
00:38:18,265 --> 00:38:20,185
We're trying to harness
this capability...

501
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:22,518
...and transfer it
into our host subject:

502
00:38:22,586 --> 00:38:24,838
Freddy the three-legged mouse.

503
00:38:25,745 --> 00:38:27,915
Enter the algorithm now.

504
00:38:30,944 --> 00:38:31,862
Need to take that?

505
00:38:37,705 --> 00:38:38,372
System ready...

506
00:38:38,504 --> 00:38:40,089
...for gene insertion.

507
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,810
Okay.

508
00:38:42,263 --> 00:38:43,641
Check.

509
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:46,593
See what l'm trying to do?

510
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:48,580
-Preempt the proteins.
-The immune response.

511

Extraordinary.

525
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:20,257
And thank you.

526
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,021
Meet Fred and Wilma...

527
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:23,431
...our three-legged...

528
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:24,666
...mice.

529
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:28,622
Here you go.

530
00:39:30,338 --> 00:39:32,007
Hey, buddy, l got you.

531
00:39:33,578 --> 00:39:34,496
Okay.

532
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,704
Careful, don't want to stick you
by mistake.

533
00:39:36,777 --> 00:39:38,655
Human trials aren't until next week.

534
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,252
There.

535
00:39:49,736 --> 00:39:51,030
Hey.

536
00:39:51,137 --> 00:39:53,515
Hey, l thought you....

537
00:39:53,576 --> 00:39:55,495
Didn't you forget something?

538
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:57,303
What?

539
00:39:57,415 --> 00:40:01,254
Now, don't answer that,
but l'm glad to know it's working.

540
00:40:02,095 --> 00:40:06,016
You owe your aunt
an apology bigtime.

541
00:40:07,854 --> 00:40:08,773
Be a man.

542
00:40:08,894 --> 00:40:10,605
Get in there and apologise.

543
00:40:13,893 --> 00:40:15,354
l'm sorry, Aunt May, l....

544
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,748
Honestly, you don't have...

545
00:40:16,854 --> 00:40:18,440
...to apologise to me. It's your--

546
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:20,328
-The hell he doesn't.
-Ben.

547
00:40:21,094 --> 00:40:22,971
Look, l'm sorry, l got distracted.

548
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,972
-Oh, he got distracted.
-Yeah.

549
00:40:25,054 --> 00:40:28,182
Your aunt, my wife,
had to walk 1 2 blocks alone...

550
00:40:28,213 --> 00:40:31,675
...in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station...

551
00:40:31,692 --> 00:40:32,944
...because you got distracted.

552
00:40:33,053 --> 00:40:34,721
Ben, sweetheart, honestly...

553
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:36,856
...l am completely capable
of walking home--

554
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:38,976
You will not defend this boy!

555
00:40:39,052 --> 00:40:40,345
-l'm not defending--
-You are!

556
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:42,954
-Listen to me, son.
-Yeah, go ahead.

557
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:44,555
You're a lot like your father.

558
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47,154
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing...

559
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:50,339
...but your father lived by a philosophy,
a principle, really.

560
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,708
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people...

561
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,192
...you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

562
00:40:56,249 --> 00:40:57,835
That's what's at stake here.

563
00:40:57,929 --> 00:40:58,931
Not choice.

564
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,052
Responsibility.

565
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:05,552
That is nice. That's great.

566
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:08,539
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

567
00:41:09,288 --> 00:41:11,500
-What?
-Where is he?

568
00:41:11,728 --> 00:41:13,522
Where's my dad?

569
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:17,112
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me himself?

570
00:41:17,128 --> 00:41:18,463
Oh, come on, how dare you?

571
00:41:18,568 --> 00:41:20,278
How dare l? How dare you?

572
00:41:24,647 --> 00:41:25,648
Where you going?

573
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:27,561
Peter, come back here, please.

574
00:41:36,646 --> 00:41:39,774
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He'll be all right.

575
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,126
Peter!

576
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:57,188
Peter?

577
00:42:02,403 --> 00:42:03,906
Peter!

578
00:42:08,722 --> 00:42:09,682
lt's _2.07.

579
00:42:12,962 --> 00:42:14,005
lt's _2.07.

580
00:42:14,123 --> 00:42:15,457
Yeah. No, l know.

581
00:42:15,562 --> 00:42:18,398
Yeah, you're holding up the line. No.

582
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:20,736
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

583
00:42:21,682 --> 00:42:22,974
-What?
-You can leave...

584
00:42:23,081 --> 00:42:25,709
...a penny anytime,
you have to spend 1 O dollars...

585
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,679
...to take a penny.
It's store policy.

586
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,180
-You're holding up my line.
-l don't have 2 cents.

587
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,909
You can't afford milk, step aside.

588
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,253
Daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?

589
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,655
We're talking about 2 cents.

590
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:36,803
Just step aside, kid.

591
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:44,404
Really?

592
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:58,585
Yo, not cool, bro.

593
00:43:01,118 --> 00:43:02,286
Hey, man, stop!

594
00:43:02,397 --> 00:43:03,857
Somebody stop that guy!

595
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,334
Hey, kid, little help?

596
00:43:05,436 --> 00:43:06,814
Not my policy.

597
00:43:07,157 --> 00:43:08,366
Somebody stop that dude!

598
00:43:09,275 --> 00:43:09,944
Hey!

599
00:43:10,077 --> 00:43:11,370
Hey, stop!

600
00:43:12,435 --> 00:43:14,063
Somebody stop that dude!

601
00:43:22,314 --> 00:43:23,191
Hey!

602
00:43:52,432 --> 00:43:54,310
Oh, God, oh, God.

603
00:43:54,391 --> 00:43:55,936
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

604
00:43:56,472 --> 00:43:58,099
Call an ambulance!

605
00:43:58,192 --> 00:44:00,611
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

606
00:44:01,112 --> 00:44:02,780
Oh, God, oh, my God.

607
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,941
Oh, God.

608
00:44:11,111 --> 00:44:12,487
No.

609
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,470
Oh, Jesus.

610
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:24,112
Witnesses gave a description to the
sketch artist. l need you to take a look.

611
00:44:28,148 --> 00:44:29,984
No, l don't know him.

612
00:44:30,828 --> 00:44:33,582
l didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives...

613
00:44:33,628 --> 00:44:35,589
...are on it.
We'll see what they turn up.

614
00:44:35,668 --> 00:44:37,336
Okay.

615
00:44:42,587 --> 00:44:44,005
Can l have that?

616
00:44:44,107 --> 00:44:45,483
Sure.

617
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:49,627
There's one other thing.
He has a star...

618
00:44:49,705 --> 00:44:50,457
... tattooed...

619
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:51,838
...on his Ieft hand.

620
00:45:18,144 --> 00:45:22,648
Peter, I know things
have been difficuIt IateIy...

621
00:45:22,902 --> 00:45:24,738
...and I'm sorry about that.

622
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,434
I think I know what you're feeling.

623
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,489
Hey, Parker.

624
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,508
-Not today.
-Come on, l just want to talk.

625
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:54,296
lt feels better, right?

626
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,681
Look, your uncle died.

627
00:45:57,259 --> 00:45:58,719
l'm sorry.

628
00:45:58,818 --> 00:46:00,279
l get it.

629
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:02,162
l'm sorry.

630
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,045
Okay?

631
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:11,270
Peter.

632
00:46:52,974 --> 00:46:54,101
Stay away from him.

633
00:46:54,213 --> 00:46:55,215
-You understand?
-Hey!

634
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,752
-Stay away from Joey.
-Hey!

635
00:46:58,853 --> 00:47:00,147
You like beating on girls?

636
00:47:00,412 --> 00:47:01,790
You like beating on old men?

637
00:47:01,892 --> 00:47:02,561
Hey, pal...

638
00:47:02,693 --> 00:47:03,486
...keep walking.

639
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:06,032
-You're in the wrong place.
-When were you in Queens?

640
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:07,742
l asked you a question.

641
00:47:07,852 --> 00:47:08,771
Nicky, no!

642
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:09,601
That the gun?

643
00:47:09,731 --> 00:47:10,817
You gonna kill me too?

644
00:47:12,692 --> 00:47:13,819
Hey! Stop it!

645
00:47:14,652 --> 00:47:15,570
Hey, get off!

646
00:47:16,612 --> 00:47:17,905
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!

647
00:47:18,012 --> 00:47:19,221
Back up!

648
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:21,918
This guy is crazy!

649
00:47:22,611 --> 00:47:23,696
Get him!

650
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,223
Get back here, man! Get him!

651
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:37,444
Follow him!

652
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:42,638
-Go around, man!
-l'll follow you!

653
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:52,319
Go, go, go!

654
00:47:53,568 --> 00:47:54,777
There he is!

655
00:47:54,887 --> 00:47:55,722
Can't get away!

656
00:48:11,646 --> 00:48:13,481
He has a star tattooed
on his Ieft hand.

657
00:48:24,804 --> 00:48:25,681
Oh, yeah?

658
00:48:25,804 --> 00:48:26,806
Come on!

659
00:48:33,883 --> 00:48:35,427
l know what you look like!

660
00:48:35,524 --> 00:48:37,317
You hear me?

661
00:48:37,643 --> 00:48:40,021
l've seen your face!

662
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,788
ls that all you got?

663
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:20,821
Just take it, take it.

664
00:49:25,878 --> 00:49:28,715
Engineered from
geneticaIIy enhanced spiders...

665
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:33,180
...Oscorp's BioCable tensile strength
is unparaIIeIed. We're just beginning...

666
00:49:33,158 --> 00:49:36,912
...to understand all the potential
industriaI appIications.

667
00:49:36,918 --> 00:49:40,422
A single pellet can safely store
several hundred metres...

668
00:49:40,437 --> 00:49:42,273
...of the lightweight cable.

669
00:49:50,795 --> 00:49:51,588
Mother....

670
00:50:46,709 --> 00:50:51,382
Attention, all units in the confines
of Precinct 13, receiving a 1 O-30...

671
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:53,644
...on West 19th Street
and Broadway.

672
00:50:53,709 --> 00:50:56,463
AssaiIant is Caucasian maIe,
mid-30s...

673
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:59,429
...170 to 180 pounds...

674
00:50:59,469 --> 00:51:00,846
...shoulder-length blond hair.

675
00:51:00,949 --> 00:51:03,577
Last seen on foot
heading eastbound on 19th Street.

676
00:51:21,907 --> 00:51:22,574
Hey.

677
00:51:30,946 --> 00:51:31,988
You got a description?

678
00:51:32,106 --> 00:51:33,316
Well, no, he wears a mask.

679
00:51:33,864 --> 00:51:35,033
A mask?

680
00:51:35,146 --> 00:51:36,314
Most of his victims...

681
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,804
...are suspects with serious rap sheets.
They're calling him a vigilante.

682
00:51:39,824 --> 00:51:42,202
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

683
00:51:42,264 --> 00:51:44,893
Help me, somebody! Arrest me!

684
00:51:44,945 --> 00:51:46,071
Get me out of here.

685
00:51:47,384 --> 00:51:48,719
Hey, look!

686
00:51:59,343 --> 00:52:01,304
Spandex. Spandex.

687
00:52:01,983 --> 00:52:02,984
Everything...

688
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:03,979
...spandex.

689
00:52:04,262 --> 00:52:06,432
Extraordinary velocity vector
is a function...

690
00:52:06,502 --> 00:52:08,338
...of both mass and acceleration.

691
00:52:08,422 --> 00:52:10,216
Come on,
you know better than anyone...

692
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:12,762
...the weight on any pendulum
has no effect on speed.

693
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:16,576
lt doesn't affect frequency,
but it's totally a factor in momentum.

694
00:52:51,297 --> 00:52:52,758
Hey, Aunt May.

695
00:52:53,377 --> 00:52:55,171
Yeah. Eggs?

696
00:52:55,257 --> 00:52:55,257
Organic, got it.

697
00:53:27,853 --> 00:53:29,856
ln the future,
if you're gonna steal cars...

698
00:53:29,934 --> 00:53:31,894
...don't dress like a car thief, man.

699
00:53:31,974 --> 00:53:33,517
What are you? You a cop?

700
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:38,508
Really? You seriously think l'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

701
00:53:38,494 --> 00:53:39,995
You know, you're....

702
00:53:40,652 --> 00:53:42,071
You've got a mind...

703
00:53:42,172 --> 00:53:43,633
...of the true scholar, sir.

704
00:53:43,731 --> 00:53:46,110
l was going more for the guys
who do the luge.

705
00:53:46,532 --> 00:53:47,658
Good thinking.

706
00:53:47,771 --> 00:53:49,315
Get out the window.

707
00:53:49,412 --> 00:53:50,705
There you go. You got it.

708
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,149
Crotch!

709
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:05,146
-Just let me go.
-ls that a real knife?

710
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,379
Yes, it's a real knife.

711
00:54:06,491 --> 00:54:07,992
My weakness, it's small knives.

712
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:09,675
-Just let me go.
-Anything but...

713
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:11,688
...knives! Oh, it's so simple.

714
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:13,230
-That was cool.
-What is this?

715
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:15,916
Webbing l developed.
l don't think you want to know.

716
00:54:15,969 --> 00:54:16,637
Let me go!

717
00:54:18,449 --> 00:54:20,159
Okay, one second.
Hold on, one second.

718
00:54:20,248 --> 00:54:21,375
Knock it off, man. No!

719
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:24,823
Come on, let me go. Stop it!

720
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:26,571
That isn't funny.

721
00:54:26,687 --> 00:54:28,148
-lt is kind of funny.
-Help!

722
00:54:38,527 --> 00:54:39,987
This could've gone a lot worse.

723
00:54:40,087 --> 00:54:42,047
Now hold still.

724
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:48,621
Boys in blue here.

725
00:54:48,726 --> 00:54:51,229
-Yo, l got him.
-Freeze!

726
00:54:51,285 --> 00:54:53,121
-He's not going anywhere.
-Don't move.

727
00:54:53,205 --> 00:54:54,207
You serious?

728
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:55,494
Who are you?

729
00:54:55,845 --> 00:54:57,556
No one grasps
the concept of the mask.

730
00:54:57,644 --> 00:54:58,438
Freeze!

731
00:55:01,284 --> 00:55:02,870
l just did 80 percent of your job.

732
00:55:03,324 --> 00:55:04,076
And that?

733
00:55:04,204 --> 00:55:05,122
That's how you repay me?

734
00:55:08,564 --> 00:55:09,732
Hold it right there!

735
00:55:29,602 --> 00:55:30,894
Well, that was fun.

736
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,868
Bus! Hey there, everybody.

737
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:38,727
What are you doing?

738
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,165
Hey, watch out.

739
00:55:44,279 --> 00:55:45,407
l'm swinging here.

740
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,022
l'm swinging here.

741
00:56:01,479 --> 00:56:04,232
So 38 of New York's finest...

742
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:07,449
...versus one guy in a unitard.

743
00:56:08,237 --> 00:56:09,406
Am l correct?

744
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,340
You don't have to wait up for me.

745
00:56:24,437 --> 00:56:25,730
-Yes, l do.
-No, you don't.

746
00:56:25,835 --> 00:56:26,837
Yes, l do.

747
00:56:26,956 --> 00:56:28,291
-Okay.
-Where were you?

748
00:56:28,396 --> 00:56:29,439
l was out.

749
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:31,517
Did you get the eggs?

750
00:56:32,916 --> 00:56:34,417
Nope. Forgot the eggs.

751
00:56:34,515 --> 00:56:35,725
l'm gonna get them now.

752
00:56:35,835 --> 00:56:37,421
No, you most certainly will not.

753
00:56:37,515 --> 00:56:39,517
Not at this hour.

754
00:56:41,193 --> 00:56:43,071
Look at me, Peter.

755
00:56:44,673 --> 00:56:47,260
Take off the damn hood
and look at me.

756
00:56:54,353 --> 00:56:57,649
Peter. Where do you go?

757
00:56:57,672 --> 00:56:59,133
Who does this to you?

758
00:56:59,232 --> 00:57:01,026
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

759
00:57:01,112 --> 00:57:03,114
-Please tell me.
-Aunt May, please...

760
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:05,236
...please, please go to sleep.

761
00:57:05,312 --> 00:57:08,357
l can't sleep.
Don't you understand? l can't sleep.

762
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,773
Peter, listen to me.

763
00:57:22,349 --> 00:57:23,560
Secrets have a cost.

764
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:25,214
They're not for free.

765
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:27,520
Not now, not ever.

766
00:57:34,828 --> 00:57:36,790
Cross-species genetics
is finally working.

767
00:57:37,029 --> 00:57:40,199
l've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.

768
00:57:40,228 --> 00:57:41,814
lt's a miracle.

769
00:57:41,909 --> 00:57:43,494
No, it's hard work and promise.

770
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:47,509
-lt's a step closer to the primate lab.
-He doesn't have time for every little step.

771
00:57:47,508 --> 00:57:48,426
Little?

772
00:57:48,547 --> 00:57:50,091
l just mean he can't wait.

773
00:57:50,186 --> 00:57:51,856
Well, he'll have to.

774
00:57:52,187 --> 00:57:53,856
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

775
00:57:53,947 --> 00:57:54,823
That's not what...

776
00:57:54,947 --> 00:57:55,781
...l'm saying.

777
00:57:55,907 --> 00:57:57,075
So, what are you saying?

778
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:59,961
You have to start human trials.

779
00:58:00,547 --> 00:58:01,298
Now.

780
00:58:01,427 --> 00:58:03,595
No, l don't, and no, l won't.

781
00:58:03,665 --> 00:58:05,626
-Well, then he's going to die.
-People die.

782
00:58:06,785 --> 00:58:08,705
Even Norman Osborn.

783
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:09,787
We are not finished.

784
00:58:09,906 --> 00:58:11,491
Human trials?

785
00:58:11,585 --> 00:58:14,171
Where are you going
to find the people to volunteer?

786
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,811
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a flu shot.

787
00:58:16,865 --> 00:58:19,743
l might think the Veterans Hospital
is a place to start.

788
00:58:19,784 --> 00:58:21,119
You've gotta be kidding me.

789
00:58:22,143 --> 00:58:23,229
l don't think l am.

790
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:31,678
lt's a little late for
shock and indignation.

791
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:32,870
About 1 5 years late.

792
00:58:33,023 --> 00:58:34,858
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

793
00:58:34,943 --> 00:58:36,445
Richard Parker wore it well.

794
00:58:36,543 --> 00:58:39,380
On you, it's a cheap suit,
as it was then.

795
00:58:39,422 --> 00:58:40,882
l had nothing to do with that.

796
00:58:40,982 --> 00:58:42,525
ls that what you told his son?

797
00:58:47,902 --> 00:58:49,195
l don't know what you're saying.

798
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,846
You don't know,
or you don't wanna know?

799
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,493
l'll remind you what happened.

800
00:58:55,581 --> 00:58:59,042
Richard Parker said iust about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

801
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:04,351
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

802
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:06,931
l....

803
00:59:14,178 --> 00:59:15,806
l won't.

804
00:59:17,859 --> 00:59:19,486
Fine.

805
00:59:23,818 --> 00:59:26,530
The formula is ours now anyway.

806
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:30,336
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

807
00:59:30,378 --> 00:59:31,921
l'm shutting you down.

808
00:59:32,017 --> 00:59:34,937
Have your office cleared out
by the morning.

809
00:59:34,977 --> 00:59:38,481
Your toys can be taken away too,
you know.

810
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:41,461
Right, Freddy?

811
00:59:56,015 --> 00:59:57,058
-Hey.
-Hi.

812
00:59:57,173 --> 00:59:57,967
How's it going?

813
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,304
Where you headed?

814
01:00:00,213 --> 01:00:02,759
-Monday, B track.
-Oh, it's Thursday.

815
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:04,761
-lt's Thursday?
-What happened?

816
01:00:04,855 --> 01:00:06,523
-What?
-Your eye, it looks bruised.

817
01:00:06,613 --> 01:00:07,865
Oh, yeah, no, l don't....

818
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:09,600
Maybe l got a rash or....

819
01:00:09,692 --> 01:00:11,487
lt's bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?

820
01:00:13,573 --> 01:00:15,283
Do you like branzino?

821
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:17,547
Like, a fish.

822
01:00:17,652 --> 01:00:19,488
No, no. l know. l know.

823
01:00:19,572 --> 01:00:21,783
Well, if you want...

824
01:00:21,853 --> 01:00:26,357
...you can come to this address
at 8:OO tonight.

825
01:00:26,932 --> 01:00:28,600
My mom's making branzino.

826
01:00:29,011 --> 01:00:30,429
So....

827
01:00:30,571 --> 01:00:31,405
lt's apartment...

828
01:00:31,531 --> 01:00:33,867
...201 6. l didn't write that part down.

829
01:00:33,932 --> 01:00:35,266
l don't know why l....

830
01:00:35,371 --> 01:00:37,206
-l'll remember it.
-Oh, okay.

831
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:38,667
201 6.

832
01:01:43,884 --> 01:01:45,219
Hi.

833
01:01:46,444 --> 01:01:47,695
How did you get out there?

834
01:01:48,484 --> 01:01:50,027
The fire escape.

835
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:52,584
Your doorman's intimidating.

836
01:01:53,403 --> 01:01:55,030
lt's 20 storeys.

837
01:01:55,322 --> 01:01:56,741
Yeah. It's all right.

838
01:02:00,681 --> 01:02:02,684
-This is your room.
-Yes, this is my room.

839
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:04,430
Books.

840
01:02:04,562 --> 01:02:06,022
Shoes.

841
01:02:06,562 --> 01:02:08,064
Oh, hey....

842
01:02:09,001 --> 01:02:10,378
l got your mom...

843
01:02:10,482 --> 01:02:11,858
...these.

844
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:13,042
Oh, lovely.

845
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,829
-Beautiful, right?
-Beautiful.

846
01:02:14,921 --> 01:02:16,298
They were nice.

847
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,194
-No, they're beautiful.
-l'm sorry.

848
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,033
No, it's impressive.
They actually held together very well.

849
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,623
l'm gonna keep these.

850
01:02:23,279 --> 01:02:24,740
You have your suit in there?

851
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,268
My suit?

852
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,737
lt's for dinner. Are you gonna--?

853
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:32,925
Are you gonna wear that?

854
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:34,040
-That's--
-Hey, hon.

855
01:02:39,399 --> 01:02:40,316
You must be Peter.

856
01:02:40,438 --> 01:02:42,273
Dad, this is Peter.

857
01:02:44,757 --> 01:02:45,967
Nice to meet you, sir.

858
01:02:47,078 --> 01:02:48,204
Nice to meet you.

859
01:02:48,317 --> 01:02:49,903
Dinner's ready.

860
01:02:50,596 --> 01:02:51,932
Hope you like branzino.

861
01:02:52,038 --> 01:02:53,581
Who doesn't?

862
01:03:50,591 --> 01:03:51,926
Emma, it's Curt.

863
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:54,802
-ls he there?
-l'm afraid not, doctor.

864
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:57,707
The car is taking him
to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.

865
01:03:57,749 --> 01:03:58,960
No. He can't, Emma.

866
01:03:59,071 --> 01:04:01,365
You have to stop him. He--

867
01:04:01,431 --> 01:04:03,850
I would, but I always lose him
on the bridge.

868
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:06,871
I'II make sure Dr. Ratha returns
your call as soon as possible.

869
01:04:16,349 --> 01:04:19,685
l'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. l'm in a hurry.

870
01:04:19,707 --> 01:04:21,752
You want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?

871
01:04:21,828 --> 01:04:23,079
Bridge! Take the bridge.

872
01:04:23,187 --> 01:04:24,523
All right, we'll do that.

873
01:04:24,626 --> 01:04:25,712
Hey, you all right...

874
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:26,578
...back there?

875
01:04:27,427 --> 01:04:28,094
You tweaking...

876
01:04:28,226 --> 01:04:29,437
...man?

877
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:32,093
Just drive.

878
01:04:32,586 --> 01:04:33,797
Okay.

879
01:04:39,745 --> 01:04:41,248
You're having trouble there?

880
01:04:41,347 --> 01:04:43,015
The head goes on the other--

881
01:04:43,105 --> 01:04:44,649
Help Gwen's friend with his fish.

882
01:04:44,745 --> 01:04:45,955
Oh, l....

883
01:04:46,066 --> 01:04:47,151
l got no idea.

884
01:04:47,264 --> 01:04:48,809
First time.

885
01:04:48,905 --> 01:04:50,490
-Branzino.
-George.

886
01:04:50,584 --> 01:04:53,338
-Tell us about your day.
-Did you catch that spider guy yet?

887
01:04:53,385 --> 01:04:54,970
No, we didn't catch him yet.

888
01:04:55,065 --> 01:04:56,941
But we will. He's an amateur...

889
01:04:57,024 --> 01:04:59,735
...who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

890
01:04:59,783 --> 01:05:01,661
He's clumsy, he leaves clues...

891
01:05:01,743 --> 01:05:03,120
...but he's still dangerous.

892
01:05:03,904 --> 01:05:05,364
He's assaulting people?

893
01:05:07,063 --> 01:05:08,064
l'm not sure.

894
01:05:08,183 --> 01:05:09,644
l mean, l saw that video...

895
01:05:09,742 --> 01:05:11,704
...with him and the car thief, and....

896
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:14,911
l think most people
would say that he was...

897
01:05:15,502 --> 01:05:16,879
...providing a public service.

898
01:05:17,503 --> 01:05:19,463
Most people would be wrong.

899
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:24,084
lf l wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

900
01:05:24,101 --> 01:05:25,353
So why wasn't he then?

901
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,184
Let me illuminate you.

902
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,929
The car thief was leading us
to the people who run...

903
01:05:32,981 --> 01:05:35,192
...the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.

904
01:05:35,259 --> 01:05:38,263
lt's called strategy.
l'm sure you're aware of the term?

905
01:05:38,299 --> 01:05:40,803
-You've heard about that in school?
-Yeah.

906
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:41,735
Good.

907
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,112
_ know.

908
01:05:43,219 --> 01:05:45,890
-He didn't know you had a plan.
-You seem to know...

909
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,691
...a lot about this.
Know something we don't?

910
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:50,073
-Whose side are you on?
-l'm not on anyone's side.

911
01:05:50,138 --> 01:05:51,515
l saw a video on the Internet--

912
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:53,162
You saw the video on the Internet.

913
01:05:53,258 --> 01:05:55,470
-Well, then the case is closed.
-Well, no.

914
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:56,498
lf you watch the video--

915
01:05:56,618 --> 01:05:58,079
Maybe send you a link?

916
01:05:58,177 --> 01:05:59,847
lt looks like he's trying to help.

917
01:05:59,939 --> 01:06:02,816
On the Internet he's being made out
to look like a hero.

918
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:03,526
No, no.

919
01:06:03,656 --> 01:06:05,367
l'm not saying he's a hero.

920
01:06:05,457 --> 01:06:07,793
-What are you trying to say?
-He's trying to help.

921
01:06:07,858 --> 01:06:09,192
He's trying to do something
the police can't.

922
01:06:09,296 --> 01:06:10,674
Something the police can't?

923
01:06:10,776 --> 01:06:12,321
-l don't know.
-What do you think we do?

924
01:06:12,417 --> 01:06:13,960
Sit around eating doughnuts...

925
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,850
...with our thumbs
planted up our asses?

926
01:06:15,937 --> 01:06:17,981
-George. George.
-Daddy.

927
01:06:18,095 --> 01:06:18,805
-Up your what?
-Howard.

928
01:06:18,936 --> 01:06:20,771
He stands for what you stand for.

929
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:22,399
Protecting innocent people
from bad guys.

930
01:06:22,496 --> 01:06:24,581
l stand for law and order.
That's what l stand for.

931
01:06:24,654 --> 01:06:26,240
Okay? l wear a badge.

932
01:06:26,335 --> 01:06:29,380
This guy wears a mask
like an outlaw.

933
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:31,960
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same...

934
01:06:32,015 --> 01:06:34,183
...like he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

935
01:06:34,253 --> 01:06:37,257
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

936
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,129
Let's get some air, Peter.

937
01:06:39,653 --> 01:06:41,823
-Dad, we need to talk.
-Yes, we do.

938
01:06:44,014 --> 01:06:45,849
Thank you for having me. l'm sorry...

939
01:06:45,933 --> 01:06:48,185
...if l insulted you.
It was not my intention.

940
01:06:48,292 --> 01:06:51,588
-You're welcome.
-Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.

941
01:06:51,612 --> 01:06:53,698
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

942
01:06:55,251 --> 01:06:57,796
-Dad.
-Yeah?

943
01:07:04,171 --> 01:07:06,091
Well, that was something.

944
01:07:07,412 --> 01:07:10,498
l'm sorry. l thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.

945
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:13,158
No, l wouldn't
have let him arrest you.

946
01:07:17,609 --> 01:07:20,321
-What happened to your face?
-l wanna tell you something.

947
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:23,261
Okay.

948
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:29,422
l've been bitten....

949
01:07:33,488 --> 01:07:34,406
So have l.

950
01:07:39,607 --> 01:07:41,026
Okay.

951
01:07:42,407 --> 01:07:44,910
Okay, okay, okay.
l gotta tell you this one thing.

952
01:07:44,968 --> 01:07:46,719
l gotta tell you this thing about...

953
01:07:46,807 --> 01:07:49,643
-...the vigilante and the car thief.
-Oh, okay.

954
01:07:49,686 --> 01:07:51,356
What?

955
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:53,699
-No, no, no.
-l don't want to talk about that.

956
01:07:53,765 --> 01:07:55,435
Forget that.
l won't talk about that.

957
01:07:55,527 --> 01:07:57,779
-l'm gonna talk about me, okay?
-What about you?

958
01:07:57,846 --> 01:08:01,683
lt's impo-- l wish l could just--

959
01:08:01,685 --> 01:08:02,937
l can't. It's hard to say.

960
01:08:03,046 --> 01:08:04,047
Just say it.

961
01:08:04,165 --> 01:08:06,293
-l don't know.
-Say it.

962
01:08:08,925 --> 01:08:10,218
What? What?

963
01:08:13,485 --> 01:08:15,195
What?

964
01:08:19,005 --> 01:08:20,881
Okay, then forget it.

965
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,063
You...?

966
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,409
-You're Spider-Man.
-Shut up.

967
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,623
Gwen?

968
01:08:47,761 --> 01:08:49,096
Gwen....

969
01:08:50,041 --> 01:08:51,960
Your father wants you to come inside.

970
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,490
Okay.

971
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,601
-Okay?
-Yeah.

972
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,283
Gwen.

973
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:00,069
l'm coming.

974
01:09:30,196 --> 01:09:30,196
Oh, l'm in trouble.

975
01:09:54,473 --> 01:09:55,350
Will you please...

976
01:09:55,473 --> 01:09:57,351
...find out what is going on, Alfred?

977
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:05,268
Excellent.

978
01:10:08,432 --> 01:10:09,392
Hey!

979
01:10:12,032 --> 01:10:13,367
Hey! What is that?

980
01:10:13,472 --> 01:10:15,350
-Oh, my God!
-l don't know!

981
01:10:15,432 --> 01:10:16,851

01:10:24,632 --> 01:10:25,507

Somebody help!

986
01:11:27,665 --> 01:11:29,333
Help me! My kid is trapped!

987
01:11:38,624 --> 01:11:39,792
l want my dad!

988
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:41,106
Dad!

989
01:11:41,223 --> 01:11:42,600
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Help!

990
01:11:42,703 --> 01:11:43,371
Hey, buddy.

991
01:11:43,502 --> 01:11:44,671
-lt's okay.
-Get away.

992
01:11:45,544 --> 01:11:46,670
-Help!
-Hey, look.

993
01:11:48,102 --> 01:11:49,980
Just a normal guy, all right?

994
01:11:51,543 --> 01:11:52,419
Wanna hold this?

995
01:11:54,023 --> 01:11:54,815
Hold my mask.

996
01:11:55,381 --> 01:11:56,299
All right.

997
01:11:57,742 --> 01:11:59,201
What's your name?

998
01:11:59,301 --> 01:12:00,095
Jack?

999
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:02,610
-Yes.
-Let's get you out of here.

1000
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,613
Okay, stay very still.

1001
01:12:05,702 --> 01:12:06,536
All right.

1002
01:12:06,661 --> 01:12:07,912
Okay, l got you.

1003
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:12,768
Okay, look.

1004
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,527
l'll undo the belt. You hold on...

1005
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:16,664
...to that seat in front of you.
On three?

1006
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:19,489
-All right.
-Okay, one, two, three.

1007
01:12:21,459 --> 01:12:23,587
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

1008
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:25,370
All right, okay.

1009
01:12:38,377 --> 01:12:39,713
Jack, climb now.

1010
01:12:39,818 --> 01:12:41,444
-l can't.
-Yes, you can.

1011
01:12:46,537 --> 01:12:48,539
Put it on, the mask.

1012
01:12:48,617 --> 01:12:50,035
lt's gonna make you strong.

1013
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:51,871
Jack, trust me.

1014
01:12:51,976 --> 01:12:52,935
Put it on.

1015
01:12:53,656 --> 01:12:56,284
There you go. That's it.
That's it, buddy.

1016
01:12:56,335 --> 01:12:57,463
Okay, now, climb.

1017
01:12:57,576 --> 01:12:58,577
Come on, Jack.

1018
01:13:02,134 --> 01:13:02,802
Do me a favour.

1019
01:13:02,935 --> 01:13:04,437
A little faster, okay, bud?

1020
01:13:04,615 --> 01:13:06,951
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

1021
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:08,099
That's it. Keep coming.

1022
01:13:08,214 --> 01:13:09,633
Keep it coming.

1023
01:13:09,735 --> 01:13:10,777
Keep coming.

1024
01:13:11,614 --> 01:13:12,949
No!

1025
01:13:26,933 --> 01:13:28,643
Jack. Oh, God.

1026
01:13:28,733 --> 01:13:30,235
Thank God.

1027
01:13:31,813 --> 01:13:33,147
You okay?

1028
01:13:36,012 --> 01:13:37,472
My son. My son.

1029
01:13:38,211 --> 01:13:39,338
Oh, my son.

1030
01:13:39,451 --> 01:13:41,204
My son.

1031
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:46,494
Who are you?

1032
01:13:48,771 --> 01:13:50,273
Spider-Man.

1033
01:14:35,365 --> 01:14:37,327
Beautiful.

1034
01:14:45,084 --> 01:14:46,128
Settle down, guys.

1035
01:14:47,044 --> 01:14:48,672
Settle down, boys. Settle down.

1036
01:14:48,765 --> 01:14:50,933
-Come on.
-Listen. At approximately...

1037
01:14:51,004 --> 01:14:54,466
...9 p.m. Iast night, an incident
took place on the Williamsburg Bridge.

1038
01:14:54,844 --> 01:14:56,679
Much of what occurred
is speculation...

1039
01:14:56,764 --> 01:14:59,559
...at this point.
However, severaI eyewitnesses...

1040
01:14:59,604 --> 01:15:03,024
...to the crime, as well as
our own preIiminary findings, have...

1041
01:15:03,042 --> 01:15:04,170
...positively placed...

1042
01:15:04,282 --> 01:15:05,952
...one individual at the scene.

1043
01:15:06,042 --> 01:15:07,502
Which is why, this morning...

1044
01:15:07,602 --> 01:15:09,020
..._ am issuing a warrant...

1045
01:15:09,121 --> 01:15:12,459
...for the masked vigiIante
known as Spider-Man.

1046
01:15:18,001 --> 01:15:21,714
And lastly, city council members met
with homeowners and airport officiaIs...

1047
01:15:21,721 --> 01:15:23,390
...in the first of four meetings....

1048
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,697
lt's so beautiful.

1049
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,635
Knows how to bite though.

1050
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,472
Who else knows about this?

1051
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,436
Just you.

1052
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,811
Really?

1053
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:42,038
Hey, you don't....

1054
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,265
You don't believe what the police
are saying, do you?

1055
01:15:45,999 --> 01:15:47,501
Of course not.

1056
01:15:49,397 --> 01:15:50,733
Does it scare you?

1057
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:52,673
What you can do?

1058
01:15:54,998 --> 01:15:56,332
No.

1059
01:15:57,356 --> 01:15:58,442
No.

1060
01:15:59,357 --> 01:16:01,443
What did that thing
on the bridge look like?

1061
01:16:01,878 --> 01:16:04,338
lt was real big.
Too big to be human.

1062
01:16:04,597 --> 01:16:06,140
You gotta lay low.

1063
01:16:06,836 --> 01:16:08,213
No, can't do that.

1064
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:09,900
You've got to.

1065
01:16:10,637 --> 01:16:12,138
l mean, why...?

1066
01:16:12,395 --> 01:16:14,857
Because of last night.

1067
01:16:14,915 --> 01:16:16,917
Those people on the bridge.

1068
01:16:16,995 --> 01:16:20,999
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

1069
01:16:22,435 --> 01:16:23,103
So...

1070
01:16:23,234 --> 01:16:24,903
...l gotta go after it.

1071
01:16:26,274 --> 01:16:27,317
That's not your job.

1072
01:16:28,634 --> 01:16:30,219
Maybe it is.

1073
01:16:34,874 --> 01:16:36,417
l really liked kissing you.

1074
01:16:38,874 --> 01:16:40,375
You're an amazing kisser.

1075
01:16:42,993 --> 01:16:44,161
Well, you know, it was--

1076
01:16:44,272 --> 01:16:46,275
lt was good for me too.

1077
01:16:48,753 --> 01:16:50,379
Yeah?

1078
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:00,478
Who did that?

1079
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:22,271
Hello!

1080
01:17:31,467 --> 01:17:33,679
lt's not nice to snoop.

1081
01:17:36,386 --> 01:17:38,264
l gave everyone the week off.

1082
01:17:40,347 --> 01:17:41,015
Yeah.

1083
01:17:42,186 --> 01:17:43,522
Shouldn't you be at school?

1084
01:17:45,146 --> 01:17:47,190
No, l got a free track.

1085
01:17:47,266 --> 01:17:49,269
l wanted to ask you a question.

1086
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:50,909
How would a predator...

1087
01:17:51,026 --> 01:17:52,320
...track a reptile?

1088
01:17:52,425 --> 01:17:55,263
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top...

1089
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:56,557
...of their food chain.

1090
01:17:56,666 --> 01:17:58,167
Kings of their domain.

1091
01:17:58,265 --> 01:17:59,767
They gotta have vulnerabilities.

1092
01:17:59,865 --> 01:18:02,451
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

1093
01:18:05,705 --> 01:18:06,998
Just asking a question.

1094
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:09,941
l got school stuff.

1095
01:18:09,984 --> 01:18:11,986
Biology profiles to do.

1096
01:18:12,304 --> 01:18:14,557
So because of the cold blood...

1097
01:18:14,624 --> 01:18:16,542
...would they react to changes
in temperatures?

1098
01:18:16,624 --> 01:18:18,000
You'd have to catch one first.

1099
01:18:18,823 --> 01:18:22,118
Did you know there's a rumour
of a new species in New York?

1100
01:18:22,142 --> 01:18:23,644
Beautiful and quite large.

1101
01:18:24,703 --> 01:18:26,663
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

1102
01:18:26,742 --> 01:18:28,744
No, it's not yet classified.

1103
01:18:31,503 --> 01:18:33,505
But it can be aggressive...

1104
01:18:34,341 --> 01:18:35,218
...if threatened.

1105
01:18:42,621 --> 01:18:43,872
Doc, you all right?

1106
01:18:43,981 --> 01:18:46,608
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

1107
01:18:46,661 --> 01:18:48,204
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1108
01:18:48,299 --> 01:18:51,053
Afraid l have to ask you to leave.
l have a new project...

1109
01:18:51,099 --> 01:18:53,519
...l'm working on.
l need to be alone.

1110
01:18:54,019 --> 01:18:56,314
Good. Good, good.

1111
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,575
Good.

1112
01:18:59,059 --> 01:19:01,979
Don't worry, Mr. Parker.
l'll be back.

1113
01:19:02,819 --> 01:19:04,946
Wonderful things are coming.

1114
01:19:06,058 --> 01:19:07,852
Wonderful things.

1115
01:19:21,737 --> 01:19:23,030
Fred?

1116
01:19:27,577 --> 01:19:29,787
Mr. Mayor,
if there was a giant dinosaur...

1117
01:19:29,856 --> 01:19:32,359
...running around
you would be the first to know.

1118
01:19:32,415 --> 01:19:34,961
So tell your son
he can rest easy, all right?

1119
01:19:35,014 --> 01:19:37,059
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

1120
01:19:37,135 --> 01:19:39,347
Okay. Bye-bye.

1121
01:19:39,414 --> 01:19:41,292
Mr. Parker, why are you...

1122
01:19:41,374 --> 01:19:43,210
-...not in school?
-Got a free track.

1123
01:19:43,294 --> 01:19:44,546
Okay, well, l do not.

1124
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:45,906
So make your point quickly.

1125
01:19:46,013 --> 01:19:48,392
Fine, there may not be a dinosaur
running around.

1126
01:19:48,453 --> 01:19:50,748
There is something more dangerous,
and l know who.

1127
01:19:50,814 --> 01:19:52,399
-You know who?
-Dr. Curtis Connors.

1128
01:19:52,494 --> 01:19:53,870
-He's a biochemist.
-Of Oscorp?

1129
01:19:53,974 --> 01:19:55,476
-That's right.
-Dr. Connors...

1130
01:19:55,574 --> 01:19:57,576
...who's my daughter's mentor.
Is that who?

1131
01:19:57,653 --> 01:19:58,863
-That's the one.
-Okay.

1132
01:19:58,973 --> 01:20:02,268
Recently, Dr. Connors gave Gwen
a college recommendation.

1133
01:20:02,292 --> 01:20:04,336
lt was beautiful.
When l read it, l cried.

1134
01:20:04,412 --> 01:20:06,582
You would have me believe
that he...

1135
01:20:06,653 --> 01:20:08,863
...is running around dressed up
like a dinosaur?

1136
01:20:08,932 --> 01:20:12,603
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur.
He has transformed himself into a lizard.

1137
01:20:15,572 --> 01:20:17,115
Let me ask you a question.

1138
01:20:17,211 --> 01:20:20,340
Do l look like the mayor
of Tokyo to you?

1139
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:22,832
l'm telling you the absolute truth.

1140
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:25,935
This man has worked for his whole life
on cross-species genetics.

1141
01:20:25,971 --> 01:20:29,516
He lost an arm, he tried to grow it back,
but the equation was imbalanced.

1142
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:31,991
He has turned into a lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

1143
01:20:32,049 --> 01:20:35,762
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. l know. l know.

1144
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:38,230
Okay. All right, l get it.

1145
01:20:38,969 --> 01:20:40,012
Here's what we'll do.

1146
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:43,202
You'll go back to hanging out
with the citizens of Tokyo.

1147
01:20:43,248 --> 01:20:45,460
l'm gonna go back
to protecting the citizens...

1148
01:20:45,528 --> 01:20:47,572
...of this fine, fair city of ours.

1149
01:20:47,648 --> 01:20:49,900
Sergeant Butler,
please escort Mr. Parker...

1150
01:20:49,968 --> 01:20:52,929
-...back to school.
-Captain Stacy, l'm not messing around.

1151
01:20:52,968 --> 01:20:56,013
Just bring him in. Just call him in.
You have to call him in.

1152
01:20:56,047 --> 01:20:57,674
He is a danger to everybody.

1153
01:20:57,767 --> 01:21:00,019
-Just, please, listen to me.
-Let's go.

1154
01:21:04,086 --> 01:21:05,422
Jimmy.

1155
01:21:06,526 --> 01:21:09,404
Get me everything we have
on Dr. Curtis Connors.

1156
01:21:09,445 --> 01:21:09,445
-Okay? Right away.
-Yeah.

1157
01:21:36,243 --> 01:21:38,204
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors.

1158
01:21:38,283 --> 01:21:39,827
Current temperature: 89.7.

1159
01:21:39,923 --> 01:21:41,383
Steady for 48 hours.

1160
01:21:41,483 --> 01:21:43,986
Blood panels reveal
Iymphocyte and monocyte readings...

1161
01:21:44,042 --> 01:21:45,711
...consistent with subject's past.

1162
01:21:51,161 --> 01:21:52,830
Clotting rate vastly improved.

1163
01:21:52,922 --> 01:21:54,423
Marked enhancement...

1164
01:21:54,521 --> 01:21:55,856
...in muscle response...

1165
01:21:55,962 --> 01:21:57,338
...strength and elasticity.

1166
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,886
Eyesight similarly improved.

1167
01:22:06,961 --> 01:22:09,463
Subiect no longer requires
corrective lenses.

1168
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,398
This is no longer about curing ills.

1169
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,216
This is about...

1170
01:22:18,318 --> 01:22:19,403
...finding perfection.

1171
01:22:28,237 --> 01:22:30,324
ln attempt to redress
regenerative relapse...

1172
01:22:30,397 --> 01:22:34,151
...dosage has been increased
to 200 milligrams.

1173
01:24:04,909 --> 01:24:06,660
You stopped me once.

1174
01:24:07,427 --> 01:24:09,764
You won't stop me again.

1175
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:14,591
l'm getting stronger every day!

1176
01:24:51,624 --> 01:24:53,167
Oh, that sucked.

1177
01:25:04,061 --> 01:25:05,731
Peter Parker.

1178
01:25:22,621 --> 01:25:24,164
Come in.

1179
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:27,795
You should maybe...

1180
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,736
...consider coming in
through the lobby.

1181
01:25:31,218 --> 01:25:34,264
Also, my father is under
the impression...

1182
01:25:34,299 --> 01:25:37,136
-...that you require psychiatric attention.
-Oh, really?

1183
01:25:37,258 --> 01:25:38,844
Peter.

1184
01:25:39,298 --> 01:25:40,300
What happened?

1185
01:25:40,418 --> 01:25:41,754
You should see the other guy.

1186
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:47,879
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

1187
01:25:47,858 --> 01:25:48,859
Hey, Gwen, honey.

1188
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:49,895
Do you want cocoa?

1189
01:25:50,017 --> 01:25:51,144
Howard's making some.

1190
01:25:55,497 --> 01:25:56,915
No, Dad, l do not want cocoa.

1191
01:25:57,016 --> 01:25:58,686
Honestly, l'm 1 7 years old.

1192
01:25:58,777 --> 01:25:59,612
Okay.

1193
01:25:59,736 --> 01:26:03,782
l remembered somebody saying her
fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.

1194
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,236
Well, that's impractical.

1195
01:26:05,335 --> 01:26:06,755
And fattening.

1196
01:26:09,816 --> 01:26:10,900
Chocolate house.

1197
01:26:13,615 --> 01:26:15,409
-Sorry, Dad.
-lt's good.

1198
01:26:15,495 --> 01:26:18,290
l can't have cocoa right now
because l'm work--

1199
01:26:18,334 --> 01:26:21,421
l'm doing this....

1200
01:26:21,455 --> 01:26:23,082
l have cramps.

1201
01:26:23,854 --> 01:26:25,898
l feel kind of pukey and just sort of....

1202
01:26:25,973 --> 01:26:28,268
-Like, emotional. l keep crying.
-lt's okay. Good.

1203
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:30,044
-Good.
-lt's brutal.

1204
01:26:30,814 --> 01:26:32,148
You don't want to know.

1205
01:26:32,252 --> 01:26:33,421
-lt's, like, bad.
-Got it.

1206
01:26:33,533 --> 01:26:35,493
-Thanks, Daddy.
-All right.

1207
01:26:59,491 --> 01:27:01,910
Easy, Bug Boy.

1208
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:03,949
What'd you call me?

1209
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:10,605
l'm going to be all right.

1210
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:13,401
-No. No.
-Yes. Yes.

1211
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:17,112
l know what this is.

1212
01:27:17,168 --> 01:27:18,503
What is it?

1213
01:27:19,368 --> 01:27:22,497
Every day, for as long
as l can remember, my father...

1214
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:23,988
...has left every morning...

1215
01:27:24,087 --> 01:27:26,758
...and he's put a badge on his chest...

1216
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:29,102
...and strapped a gun to his hip.

1217
01:27:31,568 --> 01:27:33,945
And every day,
for as long as l can remember...

1218
01:27:34,006 --> 01:27:36,468
...l haven't known if he was
gonna make it home.

1219
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:47,361
l got you.

1220
01:27:48,485 --> 01:27:49,653
Okay?

1221
01:27:52,204 --> 01:27:53,206
Okay?

1222
01:27:54,685 --> 01:27:56,771
l gotta stop him, though.

1223
01:27:57,324 --> 01:28:00,245
l have to, because l created him.

1224
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:04,744
What do you mean?

1225
01:28:06,043 --> 01:28:08,130
l gave him an equation...

1226
01:28:10,484 --> 01:28:12,611
...that made all of this possible.

1227
01:28:19,843 --> 01:28:22,721
Something my father
had been working on, you know.

1228
01:28:22,762 --> 01:28:25,765
Secretly. Now l realise
why he kept it a secret.

1229
01:28:28,321 --> 01:28:30,783
Point is, this is my responsibility.

1230
01:28:33,881 --> 01:28:36,050
l have to fix it.

1231
01:28:38,921 --> 01:28:40,589
Peter.

1232
01:28:41,521 --> 01:28:43,231
Hey.

1233
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:48,447
Let's get out of here.

1234
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,313
Let's just get out of here.

1235
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:52,110
Just for a minute. Can we?

1236
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:54,679
-No. No.
-Yeah. Yes.

1237
01:28:54,759 --> 01:28:55,927
-Yes.
-No.

1238
01:28:56,038 --> 01:28:57,207
Yes.

1239
01:28:57,317 --> 01:28:59,821
lf my parents see me leaving,
l'm dead.

1240
01:29:04,117 --> 01:29:06,203
Your parents aren't
gonna see you leaving.

1241
01:29:18,917 --> 01:29:20,544
Peter Parker.

1242
01:29:20,637 --> 01:29:22,305
Spider-Man.

1243
01:29:22,596 --> 01:29:24,348
I'm not the one who needs...

1244
01:29:24,436 --> 01:29:25,729
...help.

1245
01:29:25,876 --> 01:29:27,545
There will be no more loneliness...

1246
01:29:27,635 --> 01:29:29,095
...no more outcasts.

1247
01:29:29,195 --> 01:29:32,950
Species-wide distribution
couId enhance...

1248
01:29:32,955 --> 01:29:35,333
...humanity on an evolutionary scale.

1249
01:29:35,675 --> 01:29:38,011
One has to adapt to survive.

1250
01:29:41,113 --> 01:29:43,867
''That, changing like the snake,
l might be free...

1251
01:29:43,914 --> 01:29:47,542
...to cast off flesh
wherein l dwell confined.''

1252
01:29:47,554 --> 01:29:50,724
Would you give it all up
after all you know...

1253
01:29:50,754 --> 01:29:51,713
...you can do?

1254
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:54,461
All the power you feel.

1255
01:29:57,713 --> 01:29:58,964
l can save...

1256
01:29:59,071 --> 01:29:59,990
... them!

1257
01:30:06,391 --> 01:30:07,393
You won't get in...

1258
01:30:07,512 --> 01:30:08,680
...the way of my plan...

1259
01:30:08,791 --> 01:30:10,418
...Peter Parker!

1260
01:30:35,668 --> 01:30:36,920
Go. Go!

1261
01:31:11,745 --> 01:31:13,747
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

1262
01:31:30,504 --> 01:31:31,505
All these souls...

1263
01:31:31,623 --> 01:31:32,875
...lost and alone.

1264
01:31:32,982 --> 01:31:33,859
l can save them.

1265
01:31:33,982 --> 01:31:35,610
l can cure them.

1266
01:31:35,703 --> 01:31:37,288
There's no need to stop me...

1267
01:31:37,381 --> 01:31:38,300
...Peter.

1268
01:31:47,421 --> 01:31:49,507
You're not thinking straight, doc.

1269
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,607
Stop this. This isn't you.

1270
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,459
Let's talk this out.

1271
01:32:01,501 --> 01:32:02,251
Doc!

1272
01:32:08,059 --> 01:32:09,102
Oh, boy.

1273
01:32:14,419 --> 01:32:15,462
You don't want to talk?

1274
01:32:16,217 --> 01:32:17,761
There you go.

1275
01:32:21,177 --> 01:32:22,388
Don't...

1276
01:32:23,097 --> 01:32:24,683
...make me...

1277
01:32:24,778 --> 01:32:25,779
...have to...

1278
01:32:26,216 --> 01:32:27,177
...hurt you!

1279
01:32:34,697 --> 01:32:36,031
That is disgusting.

1280
01:32:45,616 --> 01:32:46,992
Gwen.

1281
01:33:09,893 --> 01:33:12,103
-l'm gonna throw you out the window.
-What?

1282
01:33:24,692 --> 01:33:25,735
Somebody's been...

1283
01:33:25,852 --> 01:33:27,520
...a bad lizard.

1284
01:34:12,407 --> 01:34:14,493
This is Lieutenant Williams
from the New York City...

1285
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:18,028
...Police Department.
We've got this building surrounded.

1286
01:34:26,686 --> 01:34:28,688
Alpha, let's move ahead. Go!

1287
01:34:39,765 --> 01:34:41,058
-Hey.
-Where are you?

1288
01:34:41,163 --> 01:34:42,082
l'm fine. l'm okay.

1289
01:34:42,203 --> 01:34:45,582
l'm in the sewer, tracking him. l gotta
stop him before anyone gets hurt.

1290
01:34:45,604 --> 01:34:46,730
But we need an antidote.

1291
01:34:46,843 --> 01:34:49,429
-Do you know how to run a serum?
-I do it all the time.

1292
01:34:49,483 --> 01:34:51,902
Okay, great.
Okay, l need you to go to Oscorp.

1293
01:34:51,962 --> 01:34:54,966
I need you to access the
cross-species file. It's a blue serum.

1294
01:34:55,001 --> 01:34:57,130
File 1 2389.

1295
01:34:57,201 --> 01:34:58,287
Okay, got it.

1296
01:34:58,403 --> 01:35:00,154
On my way.

1297
01:35:30,278 --> 01:35:33,908
I spent my Iife as a scientist trying
to create a world without weakness...

1298
01:35:33,918 --> 01:35:36,088
...without outcasts.

1299
01:35:36,157 --> 01:35:38,703
I sought to create
a stronger human being...

1300
01:35:38,758 --> 01:35:40,677
...but there's no such thing.

1301
01:35:40,758 --> 01:35:44,011
Human beings are weak,
pathetic, feebIe-minded...

1302
01:35:44,037 --> 01:35:45,706
...creatures.

1303
01:35:45,797 --> 01:35:47,257
Why be human at all...

1304
01:35:47,357 --> 01:35:48,609
...when we can be so...

1305
01:35:48,717 --> 01:35:49,551
...much more?

1306
01:35:49,677 --> 01:35:51,971
faster. Stronger.

1307
01:35:52,036 --> 01:35:53,455
Smarter.

1308
01:35:53,557 --> 01:35:56,393
This is my gift to you.

1309
01:36:04,435 --> 01:36:06,104
Oscorp.

1310
01:36:08,194 --> 01:36:09,321
-Captain Stacy!
-What?

1311
01:36:09,435 --> 01:36:11,896
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed...

1312
01:36:11,953 --> 01:36:14,165
-...toward Canal Street.
-What about Spider-Man?

1313
01:36:14,234 --> 01:36:15,444
lnside the high school.

1314
01:36:15,554 --> 01:36:17,473
l want that Spider-Man off the street.

1315
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:02,502
The lizard creature
has released a biological agent.

1316
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:04,338
All efforts to stop him have failed...

1317
01:38:04,423 --> 01:38:07,635
...and he is now proceeding
north on 7th Avenue. Over.

1318
01:38:11,342 --> 01:38:12,219
-Hi.
-Where are you?

1319
01:38:12,342 --> 01:38:13,636
Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp.

1320
01:38:13,742 --> 01:38:15,494
You have to get out of there now.

1321
01:38:15,582 --> 01:38:17,959
-The antidote is cooking.
-No, no, no.

1322
01:38:18,021 --> 01:38:20,483
Connors is on the way.
He's coming to you right now.

1323
01:38:20,542 --> 01:38:23,086
He needs the device.
He's gonna infect the whole city!

1324
01:38:23,141 --> 01:38:24,310
Eight minutes left.

1325
01:38:24,422 --> 01:38:26,966
You're gonna wait eight minutes
after what I told you?

1326
01:38:27,021 --> 01:38:28,356
You leave right now.

1327
01:38:28,461 --> 01:38:29,504
That is an order, okay?

1328
01:38:29,621 --> 01:38:30,705
l'll get everybody out.

1329
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:32,322
Did you hear wh--?

1330
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:35,465
Gwen! Gwen! You Mother Hubbard.
Are you serious?

1331
01:38:51,177 --> 01:38:52,346
He's heading south.

1332
01:39:02,618 --> 01:39:04,620
Stand down now, or we will open fire.

1333
01:39:04,697 --> 01:39:06,449
You are surrounded. There is...

1334
01:39:06,537 --> 01:39:07,872
...nO eSCape.

1335
01:39:08,256 --> 01:39:09,675
Go, go!

1336
01:40:09,010 --> 01:40:10,387
Clear!

1337
01:40:10,491 --> 01:40:11,617
Clear up top!

1338
01:40:13,329 --> 01:40:14,582
Clear, sir!

1339
01:40:14,691 --> 01:40:15,858
All clear here, sir!

1340
01:40:40,247 --> 01:40:41,791
Freeze!

1341
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:43,536
Down on the ground.

1342
01:40:43,647 --> 01:40:45,107
Your hands behind your head.

1343
01:40:45,206 --> 01:40:46,834
Now!

1344
01:40:50,006 --> 01:40:51,467
Parker.

1345
01:40:53,206 --> 01:40:54,208
lt's headed to Oscorp!

1346
01:40:54,326 --> 01:40:56,704
And your daughter's there right now.

1347
01:41:08,845 --> 01:41:10,138
You gotta let me go.

1348
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:24,834
Hold your fire!

1349
01:41:31,603 --> 01:41:34,105
Well, Paul, if l didn't see it,
l wouldn't believe it.

1350
01:41:34,161 --> 01:41:36,581
l won't venture to say
what it is crawling up...

1351
01:41:36,642 --> 01:41:38,561
...the north side
of the Oscorp Tower...

1352
01:41:38,641 --> 01:41:41,895
...but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

1353
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,402
Time remaining: one minute.

1354
01:43:09,272 --> 01:43:11,358
Antidote complete.

1355
01:43:23,591 --> 01:43:25,301
Oh, man.

1356
01:43:25,391 --> 01:43:28,060
We're getting the latest details.
This is just coming in.

1357
01:43:28,110 --> 01:43:29,780
The New York Police Department...

1358
01:43:29,869 --> 01:43:31,872
...has called for
a city-wide evacuation...

1359
01:43:31,949 --> 01:43:33,911
...everything south of 54th Street.

1360
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:36,423
If you are south of 54th Street...

1361
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:38,971
...you have to move out
of the area immediateIy.

1362
01:43:47,948 --> 01:43:50,535
Spider-Man appears
to be heading towards Oscorp.

1363
01:43:50,588 --> 01:43:51,631
He Iooks injured...

1364
01:43:51,748 --> 01:43:54,417
...and it's really not clear
if he's gonna make it.

1365
01:43:54,468 --> 01:43:55,553
That's the guy who...

1366
01:43:55,668 --> 01:43:57,045
...saved my boy on the bridge.

1367
01:43:57,147 --> 01:43:58,524
Troy, they're clearing us out.

1368
01:43:58,628 --> 01:44:01,047
Something bad's
going down in Midtown.

1369
01:44:01,107 --> 01:44:03,694
Still friends with Matthews,
that crane operator on 6th?

1370
01:44:03,747 --> 01:44:05,666
-Yeah.
-Get him on the phone for me.

1371
01:44:05,747 --> 01:44:07,832
The cops are evacuating everybody.

1372
01:44:07,906 --> 01:44:10,118
Get him on the phone for me.

1373
01:44:26,904 --> 01:44:29,532
Hey, Charlie, get me Enriquez
on 54th Street!

1374
01:44:29,584 --> 01:44:31,669
-You got it.
-Angelo, get your mug over here.

1375
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:34,080
Wolski! You're getting some overtime!

1376
01:44:35,303 --> 01:44:37,265
All tower cranes on 6th...

1377
01:44:37,343 --> 01:44:41,056
...swing your jib arms over the avenue.
Boom angles at 90 degrees.

1378
01:44:41,062 --> 01:44:43,399
Spider-Man needs those big boys
high and Iined up.

1379
01:44:43,463 --> 01:44:45,507
Let's give him a clear approach. Over.

1380
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:19,448
Come on, Parker.

1381
01:47:10,369 --> 01:47:11,078
Hey.

1382
01:47:11,328 --> 01:47:12,412
Dad!

1383
01:47:12,528 --> 01:47:14,697
-l have to get this to Spider-Man.
-Get in.

1384
01:47:14,768 --> 01:47:16,603
-lt can stop the Lizard.
-Get in the car.

1385
01:47:16,688 --> 01:47:19,566
-You don't understand!
-Yes, l do.

1386
01:47:19,607 --> 01:47:21,860
Your boyfriend
is a man of many masks.

1387
01:47:21,926 --> 01:47:23,095
l get it.

1388
01:47:23,206 --> 01:47:24,292
Give me this.

1389
01:47:24,406 --> 01:47:26,242
Get in the car.

1390
01:47:29,606 --> 01:47:31,692
Please make sure he's okay.

1391
01:47:43,605 --> 01:47:46,608
InitiaIising GanaIi device.

1392
01:47:46,644 --> 01:47:49,647
Detonation in T-minus two minutes.

1393
01:49:08,436 --> 01:49:10,980
Poor Peter Parker.

1394
01:49:11,955 --> 01:49:15,752
No mother, no father...

1395
01:49:16,676 --> 01:49:18,428
...no uncle.

1396
01:49:19,475 --> 01:49:21,352
All alone.

1397
01:49:22,474 --> 01:49:23,475
He's not alone.

1398
01:49:41,713 --> 01:49:44,299
Detonation in T-minus 45 seconds.

1399
01:49:52,712 --> 01:49:53,504
Hey!

1400
01:49:53,631 --> 01:49:54,382
Gift from Gwen.

1401
01:49:56,752 --> 01:49:58,211
l got this, Peter! Go!

1402
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:05,583
T-minus...

1403
01:50:05,671 --> 01:50:06,838
...30 seconds.

1404
01:50:23,828 --> 01:50:25,289
Detonation in T-minus...

1405
01:50:25,389 --> 01:50:27,099
...10 seconds.

1406
01:50:27,469 --> 01:50:28,470
Nine.

1407
01:50:29,588 --> 01:50:31,131
Eight.

1408
01:50:31,227 --> 01:50:32,605
Seven.

1409
01:50:33,027 --> 01:50:34,321
Six.

1410
01:50:35,026 --> 01:50:36,320
five.

1411
01:50:36,946 --> 01:50:37,657
four.

1412
01:50:38,547 --> 01:50:39,548
Three.

1413
01:50:41,186 --> 01:50:41,854
Two.

1414
01:50:43,507 --> 01:50:44,174
One.

1415
01:51:08,863 --> 01:51:10,532
No.

1416
01:51:11,903 --> 01:51:13,906
No!

1417
01:52:21,976 --> 01:52:23,103
The captain.

1418
01:52:24,536 --> 01:52:26,037
Captain!

1419
01:52:28,536 --> 01:52:29,954
The Lizard.

1420
01:52:30,055 --> 01:52:30,765
lt's okay.

1421
01:52:30,895 --> 01:52:32,105
We stopped him.

1422
01:52:32,695 --> 01:52:33,571
Okay.

1423
01:52:33,695 --> 01:52:35,864
Let's get you out of here.
Come on.

1424
01:52:37,055 --> 01:52:38,390
Okay, okay, okay.

1425
01:52:38,495 --> 01:52:39,955
Look at me. Stay with me.

1426
01:52:40,054 --> 01:52:42,140
-Help's on the way, okay?
-You need to....

1427
01:52:42,214 --> 01:52:45,719
You need to be gone
when they get here.

1428
01:52:45,734 --> 01:52:47,069
Okay?

1429
01:52:47,173 --> 01:52:48,467
l'm not going anywhere.

1430
01:52:48,973 --> 01:52:51,393
l was wrong about you, Peter.

1431
01:52:51,973 --> 01:52:53,517
This city needs you.

1432
01:52:55,373 --> 01:52:56,958
Here.

1433
01:52:57,052 --> 01:52:58,221
You're gonna need this.

1434
01:53:02,413 --> 01:53:04,373
You're gonna make enemies.

1435
01:53:06,612 --> 01:53:08,447
People will get hurt.

1436
01:53:09,891 --> 01:53:11,811
Sometimes the people closest to you.

1437
01:53:15,491 --> 01:53:17,493
So l want you to promise me
something, okay?

1438
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:23,047
Leave Gwen out of it.

1439
01:53:25,331 --> 01:53:26,957
Promise me that.

1440
01:53:32,290 --> 01:53:33,958
You promise me.

1441
01:54:44,562 --> 01:54:45,813
An eerie calm...

1442
01:54:45,921 --> 01:54:47,966
...has set in over New York City.

1443
01:54:48,041 --> 01:54:49,335
Apparently, some sort of...

1444
01:54:49,441 --> 01:54:52,444
...aerosolised antidote
was Iaunched from...

1445
01:54:52,481 --> 01:54:55,693
...Oscorp Tower, which seems to have
counteracted the biotoxins.

1446
01:54:55,722 --> 01:54:58,683
Residents of Lower Manhattan
can rest peacefully...

1447
01:54:58,721 --> 01:55:00,723
...knowing that
the aIIeged mastermind...

1448
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:04,429
...of this terror plot,
Dr. Curtis Connors, is behind bars.

1449
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:05,816
We've got John NiIes...

1450
01:55:05,919 --> 01:55:08,339
...on the street for a report
in Lower Manhattan.

1451
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,444
John, what do you see?

1452
01:55:41,875 --> 01:55:43,920
Sweetheart, it's all right.

1453
01:55:45,915 --> 01:55:47,793
lt's all right.

1454
01:55:48,756 --> 01:55:50,174
lt's all right.

1455
01:55:50,596 --> 01:55:51,555
Rough night.

1456
01:55:53,515 --> 01:55:55,184
lt's gonna be all right.

1457
01:56:46,670 --> 01:56:48,380
Where have you been?

1458
01:56:51,189 --> 01:56:52,775
Hi.

1459
01:56:57,349 --> 01:56:58,975
My father died.

1460
01:57:02,709 --> 01:57:04,460
There was a funeral.

1461
01:57:05,787 --> 01:57:07,123
They shot off...

1462
01:57:08,987 --> 01:57:11,741
...rifles and they made speeches.

1463
01:57:15,026 --> 01:57:16,987
Two of my teachers showed up.

1464
01:57:18,266 --> 01:57:19,643
And Flash showed up.

1465
01:57:24,306 --> 01:57:26,934
Everyone was there but you.

1466
01:57:40,824 --> 01:57:42,952
Can't do this. Can't do this.

1467
01:57:45,023 --> 01:57:47,068
l'm sorry. l can't....

1468
01:57:47,143 --> 01:57:48,562
What are you saying?

1469
01:57:48,664 --> 01:57:50,499
l can't see you anymore.

1470
01:57:52,303 --> 01:57:53,763
l can't.

1471
01:58:18,261 --> 01:58:20,263
He made you promise, didn't he?

1472
01:58:24,019 --> 01:58:27,899
To stay away from me, so l'd be safe.

1473
01:58:53,137 --> 01:58:53,972
What a pretty...

1474
01:58:54,097 --> 01:58:54,973
...girl.

1475
01:58:55,096 --> 01:58:56,265
Yeah.

1476
01:58:56,377 --> 01:58:58,170
That's what Uncle Ben said.

1477
01:58:59,095 --> 01:59:00,764
Did you ask her out?

1478
01:59:04,296 --> 01:59:05,631
Why?

1479
01:59:06,616 --> 01:59:08,076
Can't.

1480
01:59:09,255 --> 01:59:10,631
Why?

1481
01:59:13,054 --> 01:59:14,765
l'm just no good for her.

1482
01:59:17,734 --> 01:59:21,196
Peter Parker, if there's
one thing you are, it's good.

1483
01:59:22,054 --> 01:59:23,223
Anyone has a problem...

1484
01:59:23,334 --> 01:59:25,044
...with that can talk to me.

1485
01:59:41,971 --> 01:59:45,017
Peter, I know things have been...

1486
01:59:45,051 --> 01:59:46,262
...difficuIt IateIy...

1487
01:59:46,371 --> 01:59:48,457
...and I'm sorry about that.

1488
01:59:48,771 --> 01:59:51,733
I think I know what you're feeling.

1489
01:59:51,770 --> 01:59:54,357
Ever since you were a little boy...

1490
01:59:54,411 --> 01:59:58,832
...you've been Iiving with
so many unresolved things.

1491
01:59:59,809 --> 02:00:02,104
WeII, take it from an oId man:

1492
02:00:02,570 --> 02:00:05,657
Those things send us
down a road.

1493
02:00:05,690 --> 02:00:06,774
They make us...

1494
02:00:06,889 --> 02:00:07,974
...who we are.

1495
02:00:08,168 --> 02:00:13,425
And if anyone's destined for greatness,
it's you, son.

1496
02:00:13,768 --> 02:00:16,188
You owe the world your gifts.

1497
02:00:16,649 --> 02:00:19,527
You just have to figure out
how to use them.

1498
02:00:19,928 --> 02:00:23,265
And know that wherever
they take you...

1499
02:00:23,288 --> 02:00:25,582
...we'll always be here.

1500
02:00:26,287 --> 02:00:28,873
So come on home, Peter.

1501
02:00:29,607 --> 02:00:31,442
You're my hero.

1502
02:00:31,527 --> 02:00:33,029
And I love you.

1503
02:00:41,046 --> 02:00:42,757
-What's up, Parker?
-What's up?

1504
02:00:42,845 --> 02:00:44,305
Hey. How's it going?

1505
02:00:45,165 --> 02:00:46,542
You coming along, man?

1506
02:00:48,005 --> 02:00:48,840
Cool shirt.

1507
02:00:50,605 --> 02:00:51,731
Yeah.

1508
02:00:51,844 --> 02:00:53,347
Dude's crazy.

1509
02:00:53,445 --> 02:00:54,822
But chicks dig him.

1510
02:00:57,444 --> 02:01:00,155
Come on, guys, you heard the bell.
Get to class.

1511
02:01:09,122 --> 02:01:12,001
I had a professor once
who liked to tell his students...

1512
02:01:12,042 --> 02:01:15,296
...that there were only 1 O different plots
in all of fiction.

1513
02:01:16,081 --> 02:01:18,168
Well, l'm here to tell you
he was wrong.

1514
02:01:18,243 --> 02:01:19,661
There is only one:

1515
02:01:20,482 --> 02:01:21,984
''Who am l''?

1516
02:01:22,602 --> 02:01:24,520
Mr. Parker.

1517
02:01:24,602 --> 02:01:25,603
Tardy again.

1518
02:01:27,441 --> 02:01:29,277
At least we can always count on you.

1519
02:01:29,361 --> 02:01:32,114
Sorry, Miss Ritter,
won't happen again, l promise.

1520
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:34,246
Don't make promises you can't keep.

1521
02:01:36,321 --> 02:01:38,490
Yeah, but those are the best kind.

1522
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,396
Okay, class, open your books.

1523
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:42,482
Let's begin on page one.

1524
02:04:30,463 --> 02:04:33,049
Hello, doctor.

1525
02:04:33,102 --> 02:04:34,437
Did you tell the boy?

1526
02:04:34,542 --> 02:04:35,585
Tell him what?

1527
02:04:35,703 --> 02:04:39,457
Did you tell the boy
the truth about his father?

1528
02:04:40,901 --> 02:04:41,778
No.

1529
02:04:41,901 --> 02:04:43,487
Well, that's very good.

1530
02:04:43,741 --> 02:04:44,827
So we'll let him be...

1531
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:45,901
...for now.

1532
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:48,947
You should leave him alone!
