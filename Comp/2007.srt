1
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:18,023
It's me, Peter Parker.
Your friendly neighborhood...

2
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:19,235
...you know.

3
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:22,372
I've come a long way from being
the boy who was bit by a spider.

4
00:03:22,573 --> 00:03:25,406
Back then, nothing seemed
to go right for me. Now...

5
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:26,974
Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!

6
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:28,769
- Super cool!
- Spider-man!

7
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,947
...people really like me.

8
00:03:31,148 --> 00:03:33,878
Stick around. It's gonna start again
in a couple minutes.

9
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:36,644
That's okay.

10
00:03:37,855 --> 00:03:39,550
The city is safe and sound.

11
00:03:39,757 --> 00:03:41,691
I guess I've had something
to do with that.

12
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:43,655
My Uncle Ben would be proud.

13
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,591
I still get to school. Top of my class.

14
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:53,633
Now, the Hamiltonian shows us...

15
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:58,069
...that the energy levels
are perturbed by the electric field.

16
00:04:00,644 --> 00:04:05,013
From the form of this matrix,
we can see?

17
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:07,183
Miss Stacy?

18
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:10,615
That only the "m equals zero
quantum states" are affected.

19
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:13,881
Correct. Good work, Miss Stacy.

20
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:21,261
Parker? You got something to add?

21
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:23,760
No, sir.

22
00:04:26,203 --> 00:04:30,299
And I'm in love
with the girl of my dreams.

23
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:47,189
Hi.

24
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:51,794
Miss Watson left a ticket for me.
Peter Parker.

25
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:54,320
Excuse me. Sorry.

26
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:56,931
Thank you. Sorry.

27
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:05,302
I'm so nervous.

28
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,430
That's my girlfriend.

29
00:06:45,475 --> 00:06:48,035
- I thought she was good.
- Yeah.

30
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:50,739
Harry?

31
00:06:50,948 --> 00:06:52,347
Harry!

32
00:06:52,549 --> 00:06:54,540
I need to talk to you.

33
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:56,914
Explain things.

34
00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:02,550
Tell it to my father.
Raise him from the dead.

35
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:08,092
I'm your friend, Harry.
I cared about your father.

36
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
M. J!

37
00:07:18,442 --> 00:07:20,706
- Peter!
- Congrats!

38
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:23,141
- Was I good?
- Good? You were great.

39
00:07:23,347 --> 00:07:25,645
- You were...
- You said great.

40
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:29,341
I love my flowers, they're beautiful.
And those are from Harry.

41
00:07:29,553 --> 00:07:33,455
- Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.

42
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:36,751
- What's with you guys anyway?
- It's complicated.

43
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,951
Tell me again. Was I really good?

44
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:41,494
I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.

45
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:44,166
- Your knees were fine.
- The applause wasn't very loud.

46
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:46,268
Yes, it was. Well, it's the acoustics.

47
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,598
It's all about diffusion. It keeps
the sound waves from grouping.

48
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:52,604
When the sound waves,
they propagate, then it's like an...

49
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:54,777
You are such a nerd.

50
00:08:47,664 --> 00:08:49,529
Did you see that one?

51
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:00,470
You know what?

52
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:05,503
I'd like to sing on-stage
for the rest of my life...

53
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:08,081
...with you in the first row.

54
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,250
I'll be there.

55
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:15,450
Tell me you love me.

56
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:19,595
I love you.

57
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,291
I love you so much.

58
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,124
I always have.

59
00:10:12,883 --> 00:10:14,316
- Ready?
- Yep.

60
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,264
You can't hide here, Flint.

61
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:16,832
- I'm just here to see my daughter.
- You are an escaped convict.

62
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,771
The cops are looking for you.
You're not getting near her.

63
00:12:21,244 --> 00:12:24,441
You're nothing but a common thief.

64
00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:28,106
- You maybe even killed a man?
- It wasn't like that.

65
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,646
It wasn't.

66
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:32,981
I had good reason
for what I was doing.

67
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:34,383
And that's the truth.

68
00:12:34,591 --> 00:12:38,755
You and the truth, sitting in prison,
having three meals a day together.

69
00:12:38,962 --> 00:12:41,487
I live in the presence of great truth...

70
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:43,996
...and that is the truth
that you left behind...

71
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,964
...right there in that bedroom.

72
00:13:00,183 --> 00:13:01,878
Penny.

73
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:04,513
I missed you.

74
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:08,246
I miss you too, Daddy.

75
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:22,761
I promise I'll make you healthy again.

76
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:25,873
Whatever it takes, I'll get the money.

77
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:29,136
You get out of here. Now.

78
00:13:40,523 --> 00:13:42,423
I'm not a bad person.

79
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:46,352
Just had bad luck.

80
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:05,874
Peter, what is it?

81
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:09,478
It's M.J.

82
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:13,811
- I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- Oh, Peter.

83
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:20,558
The day your Uncle Ben asked me
to marry him, we were so scared.

84
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:22,561
And excited.

85
00:14:22,766 --> 00:14:24,529
And very young.

86
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:27,601
And I loved him so fiercely.

87
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:29,829
- And you said yes, right?
- No.

88
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,405
I wanted to say yes, but I said no.

89
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:35,305
I wasn't ready. Neither was he.

90
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:37,776
So we took our time.

91
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:40,347
Looked forward to it.

92
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,111
Didn't want to run into something
with nothing to count on but love.

93
00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:48,352
A man has to be understanding...

94
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:51,584
...and put his wife before himself.

95
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:54,895
Can you do that, Peter?

96
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:59,296
Yeah, I think I can.

97
00:14:59,502 --> 00:15:02,801
Then you have my blessing.

98
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:07,966
I hope you've considered
a proper proposal.

99
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:11,511
Your uncle had it all planned.

100
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:13,614
He took me to the beach
one Sunday.

101
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:16,581
Oh, he was a knockout
in his bathing suit.

102
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:19,254
And I didn't look too bad myself.

103
00:15:19,456 --> 00:15:21,424
We were very good swimmers.

104
00:15:21,624 --> 00:15:24,115
And it was a beautiful day
and he said:

105
00:15:24,327 --> 00:15:26,227
"Let's swim to the island."

106
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:31,799
And at the island, we found
a perfect spot by an old tree...

107
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:35,493
...and we lay down
and looked up at the sky.

108
00:15:35,705 --> 00:15:38,936
And then he said,
"Close your eyes, May."

109
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:41,872
And I did.
And then he said, "Open them."

110
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:43,841
And I did.

111
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:46,914
And he was holding this ring.

112
00:15:48,284 --> 00:15:49,717
Dazzling...

113
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,614
...in front of me.

114
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,390
I thought it was the sun.

115
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:01,626
We'd be married 50 years...

116
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:05,396
...come August if...

117
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,406
So...

118
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:20,414
...I hope you'll make it very special
for Mary Jane.

119
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:24,286
Do something she'll never forget.

120
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,882
Give her this.

121
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,288
Go on. Take it.

122
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,940
- Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.

123
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,170
Listen to me. I didn't kill your father.

124
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,984
He was trying to kill me.
He killed himself.

125
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:04,915
Shut up!

126
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:49,288
I'm still here, Peter.

127
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,380
Hate those things.

128
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,543
Harry?

129
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:20,948
Harry.

130
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:23,508
Harry.

131
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:30,291
Oh, my God.

132
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,464
Harry!

133
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:42,234
Come on!

134
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:46,568
God.

135
00:21:50,213 --> 00:21:51,441
- Defib.
- Two hundred.

136
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:53,376
And clear.

137
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,777
No response.

138
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:56,713
- Recharge, let's go again.
- Go ahead.

139
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:59,319
- Charging.
- And clear.

140
00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:00,522
No response.

141
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,853
Let's recharge and do it
one more time. And clear.

142
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:11,055
Captain Stacy.

143
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:13,129
- What's this?
- Flint Marko.

144
00:22:13,336 --> 00:22:15,395
The guy we tied
to the Ben Parker homicide.

145
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:17,402
- What about him?
- Broke out of Rikers.

146
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:18,904
- And?
- He's on the run.

147
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:21,235
He's in the marshlands.
I think we got him.

148
00:22:25,548 --> 00:22:27,175
There he is.

149
00:22:45,935 --> 00:22:48,802
You two, take the west side.
Tommy, take the east.

150
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:54,836
Where did he go?

151
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:18,627
- Capacitors charged.
- Right.

152
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,825
Donnie, we got a little fluctuation
on one.

153
00:23:21,037 --> 00:23:24,700
- There's a change in the silicon mass.
- It's probably a bird. It'll fly away.

154
00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:26,636
Initiating demolecularization.

155
00:24:56,665 --> 00:24:58,656
- How is he?
- He's gonna be okay.

156
00:24:58,868 --> 00:25:01,234
But there's been
some memory impairment.

157
00:25:01,437 --> 00:25:03,064
Particularly his short-term memory.

158
00:25:03,272 --> 00:25:05,297
Right now he can't
remember the accident...

159
00:25:05,508 --> 00:25:07,567
...or anything that happened
to him recently.

160
00:25:07,777 --> 00:25:09,005
Is it permanent?

161
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:12,203
It could be. Only time will tell.

162
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:14,809
He's awake if you wanna see him.

163
00:25:15,017 --> 00:25:16,245
Maybe I should wait.

164
00:25:16,452 --> 00:25:19,751
No, it's fine. Just keep it brief.
I want him to rest.

165
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:40,203
Hey, buddy.

166
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,309
Hey.

167
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:44,569
Hit my head.

168
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,247
Yeah.

169
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:48,779
Doctor said I was in an accident.

170
00:25:48,984 --> 00:25:50,042
Hit-and-run.

171
00:25:50,786 --> 00:25:53,277
I don't remember much of anything.

172
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:56,484
My father...

173
00:25:57,126 --> 00:25:58,559
...he died, right?

174
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:03,296
This is all so weird.

175
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,058
Hi. I got here as fast as I could.

176
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,270
I know that face.

177
00:26:09,738 --> 00:26:10,932
How you doing?

178
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,607
I don't know.

179
00:26:12,808 --> 00:26:14,833
Last thing I remember, I was fine.

180
00:26:15,044 --> 00:26:16,136
Somewhere.

181
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:18,107
You're still fine.

182
00:26:19,715 --> 00:26:21,512
We love you, Harry.

183
00:26:22,218 --> 00:26:24,152
It feels like...

184
00:26:25,054 --> 00:26:28,455
...somehow I've been gone
for a really long time.

185
00:26:30,126 --> 00:26:31,753
And now I'm back home.

186
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:34,588
It's good to have you back.

187
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:38,692
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask
you guys to scoot, okay?

188
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:41,165
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

189
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,304
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

190
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:45,497
Yeah. Great.

191
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:47,832
Get some sleep.

192
00:26:51,347 --> 00:26:53,815
- I think he's gonna be fine.
- I think so.

193
00:26:54,016 --> 00:26:56,610
- And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.

194
00:26:59,822 --> 00:27:01,380
You have lovely friends.

195
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,649
My best friends.

196
00:27:06,362 --> 00:27:08,489
I'd give my life for them.

197
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:20,417
- Yeah?
- It's me.

198
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,689
Hey.

199
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:25,219
Peter, you know I can't open the door.

200
00:30:25,427 --> 00:30:26,826
It's stuck again?

201
00:30:27,363 --> 00:30:29,422
Just come on and help me.

202
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:31,155
I'm coming.

203
00:30:37,406 --> 00:30:39,533
- Hey.
- The review.

204
00:30:40,342 --> 00:30:43,402
- They hated it. They hated me.
- Well, they can't hate you.

205
00:30:43,612 --> 00:30:45,842
"The young Miss Watson
is a pretty girl...

206
00:30:46,048 --> 00:30:48,141
...easy on the eyes,
but not on the ears.

207
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,614
Her small voice didn't carry
past the first row."

208
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:52,844
That's ridiculous, I was right there.

209
00:30:53,055 --> 00:30:54,579
You were in the first row.

210
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,123
Yeah, this... Listen, you were great.

211
00:30:58,594 --> 00:31:02,690
That's a critic. This is something
you're gonna have to get used to.

212
00:31:02,898 --> 00:31:06,356
Believe me, I know.
Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.

213
00:31:06,568 --> 00:31:10,527
This isn't about you. This is about me.
It's about my career.

214
00:31:10,739 --> 00:31:14,175
I know, and I'm just saying
you can't let it bring you down.

215
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:17,106
You gotta believe in yourself
and pull yourself together.

216
00:31:17,312 --> 00:31:18,939
You get right back
on the horse and...

217
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:20,945
Don't give me the horse thing.

218
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,550
Try and understand how I feel.

219
00:31:28,557 --> 00:31:30,184
It's just...

220
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:35,288
...I look at these words...

221
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:38,596
...and it's like my father wrote them.

222
00:31:39,735 --> 00:31:43,865
All cars. All cars in the vicinity of
54th and Sixth Avenue, please report.

223
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:46,700
Crane out of control,
approach with caution.

224
00:31:49,978 --> 00:31:51,673
"Go get them, tiger"?

225
00:31:53,982 --> 00:31:55,540
I'm sorry.

226
00:32:28,717 --> 00:32:31,049
Oh, my God. 7-Adam to Central.

227
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:34,051
That crane job you sent us on?
It's bigger than we thought.

228
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:37,521
We're gonna need
a major mobilization right away.

229
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,330
Shut it down at the generator. Now!

230
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:54,071
Okay, Gwen, I've got a secret:
It's my copier.

231
00:32:57,312 --> 00:33:00,042
What is that thing
doing in my background?

232
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:28,503
They got some kind of short.
Can't shut down the crane.

233
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,508
Get Edison on the phone.
Kill the power to the whole block.

234
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,250
Are you all right?

235
00:33:36,451 --> 00:33:38,043
It's coming back.

236
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:41,179
Oh, no.

237
00:34:05,013 --> 00:34:07,914
- Oh, my God. That's Gwen.
- What?

238
00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:14,452
What's she doing up there?

239
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:17,420
I just saw her last night.
She said she had a modeling gig.

240
00:34:17,626 --> 00:34:20,561
- Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

241
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:22,491
And I work at the Daily Bugle.

242
00:34:23,298 --> 00:34:25,596
And I'm dating your daughter.

243
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:22,320
You okay?

244
00:35:22,524 --> 00:35:24,890
Yeah, I'm fine.

245
00:35:25,093 --> 00:35:26,093
Thank you.

246
00:35:26,294 --> 00:35:28,626
Hey, Spidey, hold on.
Bugle needs a photo.

247
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,627
- Thank God you're okay.
- Daddy.

248
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:32,732
Hey. I'm the new guy.

249
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:33,958
New guy?

250
00:35:35,704 --> 00:35:36,704
You okay?

251
00:35:36,872 --> 00:35:39,739
From now on, I am gonna be
taking shots of you for the Bugle.

252
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:42,739
So smile. Are you smiling?
Just kidding.

253
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:45,435
- They got a guy.
- Who, Parker?

254
00:35:45,881 --> 00:35:50,011
Yeah, look, just between you and me,
guy's kind of an amateur.

255
00:35:50,218 --> 00:35:52,880
Have you noticed his stuff
makes you look a little bloated?

256
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:55,352
Just... Yeah, a little chunky.

257
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:57,349
Okay.

258
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,494
But you don't have to worry about that
anymore, buddy.

259
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:10,438
Dazzle me.

260
00:36:18,113 --> 00:36:20,946
Just something the boys in
the Ad Department and I whipped up.

261
00:36:21,149 --> 00:36:24,016
As you know, circulation at the Bugle's
been pretty good.

262
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:26,084
Though not as good
as The New York Times.

263
00:36:26,288 --> 00:36:28,984
Or the Daily News, or the Post,
or several other smaller...

264
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:31,159
Get on with it, you moron...!

265
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,293
- What?
- Your blood pressure, Mr. Jameson.

266
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:36,692
- Your wife told you to watch the anger.
- You tell my wife...

267
00:36:40,335 --> 00:36:42,098
Thank you.

268
00:36:43,939 --> 00:36:46,931
So I propose this campaign.

269
00:36:47,142 --> 00:36:49,576
"Daily Bugle." That's obvious.

270
00:36:49,778 --> 00:36:52,872
"It's hip, it's now."
I came up with that one.

271
00:36:53,815 --> 00:36:56,477
"It's wow." That's actually Erickson.
He goes crazy.

272
00:36:56,685 --> 00:36:58,915
We gave him a couple lattes,
it's like:

273
00:36:59,254 --> 00:37:02,121
"And how." That's me again.

274
00:37:02,657 --> 00:37:04,420
Time to take your pill.

275
00:37:05,694 --> 00:37:07,321
Not that one.

276
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:09,757
Not that one.

277
00:37:17,939 --> 00:37:20,305
Drink plenty of water.

278
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:25,645
Thank you.

279
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:29,049
Continue.

280
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:35,182
- He's busy.
- I'm just here to talk to you, beautiful.

281
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,914
What's that smell?

282
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:40,390
That's a little something called
Nice and Easy. What's on you?

283
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:42,153
It's called Go Away.

284
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:44,298
That is the dumbest idea
you've ever had...

285
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:47,366
- ...and you have had some doozies.
- Blood pressure.

286
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:49,532
Hey, where are you going?

287
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:53,733
- Who are you?
- You hired him last week. Freelance.

288
00:37:53,975 --> 00:37:56,808
- I did? What's that smell?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

289
00:37:57,012 --> 00:38:00,311
Can I just say I really like that shirt?
It's the crane accident.

290
00:38:00,515 --> 00:38:02,346
- Check out the light.
- He likes my shirt.

291
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:03,643
- Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete.

292
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:05,547
You better get in there. New guy.

293
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:08,587
He's trying to sell
some Spidey photos.

294
00:38:10,158 --> 00:38:11,648
Thanks.

295
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,795
Parker. You're late, maybe too late.
Bruckner beat you to it.

296
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:16,554
It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

297
00:38:16,765 --> 00:38:19,063
- But I got you this.
- But he got me this.

298
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:21,599
I didn't see you there.
How'd you get that high?

299
00:38:21,803 --> 00:38:24,601
- Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.
- A flagpole?

300
00:38:24,806 --> 00:38:27,639
- Which one do we use?
- I like Bernstein's.

301
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:29,037
- It's better.
- Cheaper too.

302
00:38:29,244 --> 00:38:31,906
Congratulations, we'll use yours.
I'll pay you 50 bucks.

303
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:33,512
All right, J.J., I'm your man.

304
00:38:33,715 --> 00:38:36,377
I know more about a good picture
than any photographer.

305
00:38:36,585 --> 00:38:40,282
See, photography, it's not just about,
no offense, flagpoles or whatever.

306
00:38:40,488 --> 00:38:42,683
It's about lighting.
Composition. Drama.

307
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:44,990
I want a staff job, sir.

308
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:48,321
I have a girl that I intend to marry...

309
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,397
...and I guess, I don't know,
I have this stupid little dream...

310
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,036
...of working with one of the greatest
newspaper editors of our time.

311
00:38:55,704 --> 00:38:57,001
J. Jonah Jameson.

312
00:39:00,475 --> 00:39:03,205
Well, we do have an opening.
Johnson quit, remember?

313
00:39:03,411 --> 00:39:04,537
- You fired him.
- Whatever.

314
00:39:04,746 --> 00:39:07,647
I know what makes a good picture
and I've been here a long time.

315
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:09,908
If there's a staff job,
I think I deserve it.

316
00:39:10,118 --> 00:39:13,849
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us
for years. He's done a great job.

317
00:39:14,055 --> 00:39:15,989
You want a staff job,
you want a staff job.

318
00:39:16,191 --> 00:39:17,988
- Anybody care about what I want?
- I do.

319
00:39:18,193 --> 00:39:19,956
Shut up. Get out.

320
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:23,562
I want the public to see Spider-Man
for the two-bit criminal he really is.

321
00:39:23,765 --> 00:39:27,929
He's a fake, he's full of stickum.
Catch him in the act.

322
00:39:28,136 --> 00:39:30,400
Spider-Man with his hand
in a cookie jar.

323
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:32,539
Whoever brings me that photo
gets a job.

324
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:34,606
What're you waiting for,
Chinese New Year?

325
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:36,208
I'm on it, boss.

326
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:38,940
You'll never get that shot.

327
00:39:39,147 --> 00:39:40,478
Oh, we'll see.

328
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:59,990
You know, I guess one person
can make a difference.

329
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:03,298
Enough said.

330
00:40:08,543 --> 00:40:11,011
Welcome home, Harry.

331
00:40:11,846 --> 00:40:15,145
- Thank God you're all right.
- Thanks, Bernard.

332
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,511
- Bernard.
- Sir.

333
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:22,012
Got you a little homecoming present.

334
00:40:23,124 --> 00:40:24,785
- It's your old ball.
- Yeah.

335
00:40:24,993 --> 00:40:26,085
Thanks, buddy.

336
00:40:26,861 --> 00:40:29,091
We were pretty good
in the backyard, weren't we?

337
00:40:29,297 --> 00:40:32,926
We were terrible.
And we tried out for the varsity team.

338
00:40:33,134 --> 00:40:35,125
- For the cheerleaders.
- Right.

339
00:40:35,337 --> 00:40:37,862
- Hey, do I have any girlfriends?
- I don't know.

340
00:40:38,073 --> 00:40:39,199
You don't?

341
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:42,368
Hey, Bernard.
Do I have any girlfriends?

342
00:40:42,577 --> 00:40:45,045
Not that I know of, sir.

343
00:40:50,585 --> 00:40:52,177
It's a pretty cool pad, huh?

344
00:40:52,387 --> 00:40:54,048
It's okay.

345
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:57,156
- Looks like I'm not hurting for money.
- No.

346
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,125
Well, maybe I can turn this
no-girlfriend thing around.

347
00:41:08,703 --> 00:41:13,538
You know, he always appreciated how
you helped me through high school.

348
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:16,903
Just wish I could remember
more about him.

349
00:41:18,413 --> 00:41:21,871
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.

350
00:41:23,018 --> 00:41:27,387
Hey, let's watch a game in the kitchen.
Get something to eat.

351
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:28,715
Okay.

352
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,217
Heads up.

353
00:41:34,896 --> 00:41:35,896
Did you see that?

354
00:41:36,698 --> 00:41:38,893
- Still got the moves.
- Yeah.

355
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:13,693
Why are we stopping?

356
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:18,863
What is she doing here?

357
00:42:19,074 --> 00:42:20,939
Well, Gary was supposed
to call her agent.

358
00:42:23,578 --> 00:42:26,206
Hi, honey. We tried to reach you.

359
00:42:26,414 --> 00:42:27,904
I'm sorry.

360
00:42:28,116 --> 00:42:29,208
One critic?

361
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:30,577
No, all the papers, dear.

362
00:42:31,586 --> 00:42:33,986
Mary Jane, honey, sit down.
Let us explain it to you.

363
00:42:34,189 --> 00:42:36,749
Listen, if you'd like,
we could say you became ill.

364
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:49,736
That was so poorly handled.

365
00:42:49,938 --> 00:42:51,405
Yeah.

366
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,771
Let's just rehearse.

367
00:42:59,481 --> 00:43:01,779
All right, Spidey.

368
00:43:40,088 --> 00:43:42,056
Spidey! Spidey! Spidey!

369
00:43:42,257 --> 00:43:45,818
Excuse me, miss? Could I please
see that gorgeous smile?

370
00:43:46,027 --> 00:43:47,756
Hi, Eddie.

371
00:43:47,962 --> 00:43:51,056
You're so beautiful.
This is front-page stuff.

372
00:43:51,266 --> 00:43:52,824
I gotta practice. See you later.

373
00:43:53,034 --> 00:43:54,899
- How about tonight?
- Not tonight.

374
00:43:55,103 --> 00:43:56,502
Why not?

375
00:43:56,704 --> 00:44:00,572
What about that amazing,
amazing night that we had?

376
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:04,803
We had a coffee, Eddie.

377
00:44:05,013 --> 00:44:06,674
Hey, beautiful.

378
00:44:07,382 --> 00:44:08,815
One more.

379
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,452
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

380
00:44:14,656 --> 00:44:18,752
- You're not still mad at me, are you?
- No, Peter, I'm proud of you.

381
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,019
Hey, I'm gonna be swinging in
from over there.

382
00:44:21,229 --> 00:44:23,288
- Oh, yeah?
- So you know where to look.

383
00:44:24,899 --> 00:44:26,230
Give them a good show.

384
00:44:27,101 --> 00:44:28,466
Don't worry about that review.

385
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:32,106
We're gonna be laughing about it
tomorrow night, I promise.

386
00:44:32,307 --> 00:44:33,831
Yeah.

387
00:44:50,525 --> 00:44:53,153
Isn't that that guy
from that prison break?

388
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:54,860
He fits.

389
00:44:55,063 --> 00:44:57,554
Hey, you. Halt.

390
00:44:58,399 --> 00:44:59,991
Cover the back.

391
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:05,596
Hon, be careful.

392
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:55,246
He's in the truck.

393
00:45:55,456 --> 00:45:57,424
Round the front.

394
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:11,972
Fire.

395
00:46:36,164 --> 00:46:37,654
People of the city of New York...

396
00:46:37,865 --> 00:46:41,323
...I am here today
because I fell 62 stories...

397
00:46:41,536 --> 00:46:43,128
...and someone caught me.

398
00:46:43,338 --> 00:46:46,307
Someone who never asks
for anything in return.

399
00:46:46,507 --> 00:46:50,136
Someone who doesn't even want us
to know who he is.

400
00:46:50,345 --> 00:46:51,369
Hey, M.J.

401
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:53,911
- Harry.
- Hey.

402
00:46:54,115 --> 00:46:55,480
Where's Pete?

403
00:46:56,351 --> 00:46:58,410
- Taking somebody's picture, I guess.
- Right.

404
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:01,349
I'm so happy to see you.
You look so good, Harry.

405
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:02,853
I've never felt better.

406
00:47:03,057 --> 00:47:05,150
It's a weird feeling
not knowing who you are.

407
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,090
Bump on the head,
I'm as free as a bird.

408
00:47:08,363 --> 00:47:10,593
Will you bump me on the head?

409
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:14,997
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.

410
00:47:15,236 --> 00:47:17,864
You came. You sent me flowers.

411
00:47:18,072 --> 00:47:20,540
I did? I'll come again tonight.

412
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:24,235
You can't. I was let go.

413
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:26,140
What happened?

414
00:47:27,782 --> 00:47:29,249
I wasn't very good.

415
00:47:30,785 --> 00:47:32,753
You know, this is embarrassing...

416
00:47:32,954 --> 00:47:35,218
...but I once wrote you a play
in high school.

417
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,050
- You wrote me a play?
- Yeah.

418
00:47:37,258 --> 00:47:38,816
Harry, that's the sweetest thing.

419
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:42,189
So I ask you: When you're dropping
without a parachute...

420
00:47:42,397 --> 00:47:45,764
...or your store's being robbed
or your house is on fire...

421
00:47:45,967 --> 00:47:48,026
...who is it that breaks your fall...

422
00:47:48,236 --> 00:47:51,865
...puts out the flames
and saves your children?

423
00:47:52,073 --> 00:47:53,700
Spider-Man.

424
00:47:53,908 --> 00:47:54,966
They love me.

425
00:47:55,176 --> 00:47:58,475
Then let's hear it
for your one and only...

426
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:03,116
...friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man.

427
00:48:15,196 --> 00:48:18,359
Hey. What's up? All right.
How you doing?

428
00:48:20,034 --> 00:48:21,934
Shazam!

429
00:48:24,005 --> 00:48:25,005
Hey, guys.

430
00:48:25,173 --> 00:48:26,765
Spider-Man. Spider-Man.

431
00:48:26,974 --> 00:48:29,135
Hey there. Hi.

432
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:32,240
- Kiss him.
- Kiss him.

433
00:48:32,447 --> 00:48:35,143
Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.

434
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,740
Go ahead, lay one on me.

435
00:48:37,952 --> 00:48:39,681
- Really?
- Yeah, they'll love it.

436
00:48:39,887 --> 00:48:41,354
- Kiss her.
- Kiss him.

437
00:48:41,556 --> 00:48:42,818
No, Spider-Man, no.

438
00:48:43,024 --> 00:48:44,889
All right.

439
00:48:53,634 --> 00:48:56,330
Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.

440
00:49:01,843 --> 00:49:03,743
Hey, hey, are you okay?

441
00:49:03,945 --> 00:49:05,276
Yeah, I'm fine.

442
00:49:51,259 --> 00:49:53,250
Hey, man,
we got something on the roof.

443
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,076
Jig's up, pal.

444
00:50:17,952 --> 00:50:20,716
I don't wanna hurt you. Leave now.

445
00:50:20,922 --> 00:50:24,119
I guess you haven't heard.
I'm the sheriff around these parts.

446
00:50:24,325 --> 00:50:25,349
Okay.

447
00:51:04,098 --> 00:51:05,531
Help!

448
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:42,526
Where do all these guys come from?

449
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,387
I'm sorry, I don't speak...

450
00:52:37,591 --> 00:52:40,890
But this is a French restaurant, non?

451
00:52:43,931 --> 00:52:46,900
- Name, please?
- Parker, Peter.

452
00:52:50,771 --> 00:52:52,033
Here we are.

453
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:54,400
Table for two. Parker.

454
00:52:55,609 --> 00:52:59,636
- Parker.
- That is what I said: Parker.

455
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,015
I have a request.

456
00:53:04,218 --> 00:53:08,621
My girlfriend will be coming
and I have this ring.

457
00:53:13,928 --> 00:53:15,486
Hello.

458
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:18,529
Oh, so you want to
pop the question tonight, huh?

459
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:21,531
Yes, and I wanna do something
very special.

460
00:53:21,736 --> 00:53:24,170
I love it. Romance.

461
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:25,895
I am French.

462
00:53:27,942 --> 00:53:31,434
When I signal you, if you'd bring some
champagne with the ring...

463
00:53:31,645 --> 00:53:33,943
- In the bottom of her glass?
- Perfect.

464
00:53:35,049 --> 00:53:37,176
Also, I thought at the same time...

465
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:40,911
...if the musicians
would play this song...

466
00:53:42,022 --> 00:53:44,081
Their favorite.

467
00:53:44,492 --> 00:53:46,892
And take good care of the ring.

468
00:53:47,094 --> 00:53:49,585
Oui, with my life, monsieur.

469
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,292
I like you.

470
00:53:57,471 --> 00:53:58,938
Thank you.

471
00:54:10,251 --> 00:54:12,412
Okay, so...

472
00:54:12,953 --> 00:54:15,251
Oh, would you like
some champagne?

473
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:21,018
How'd that get in there?

474
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:24,590
Oh, don't cry.

475
00:54:29,703 --> 00:54:30,761
Hi.

476
00:54:31,906 --> 00:54:33,897
Look at you. Wow, beautiful.

477
00:54:34,108 --> 00:54:35,632
Thanks.

478
00:54:39,914 --> 00:54:41,438
This place in your budget?

479
00:54:41,649 --> 00:54:43,810
Oh, well, it's a special occasion.

480
00:54:44,552 --> 00:54:46,042
You're on Broadway.

481
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:49,422
I don't feel like
much of a star tonight.

482
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:52,888
Well, you are a star.
And you've earned it.

483
00:54:53,527 --> 00:54:54,653
Peter...

484
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,164
...you have no idea
how I feel right now.

485
00:54:58,365 --> 00:55:01,357
Oh, no, I know exactly how you feel.

486
00:55:01,936 --> 00:55:06,236
Listen, I have been through this.
It happens to me all the time.

487
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,374
I see Spider-Man posters
in the window...

488
00:55:08,576 --> 00:55:10,874
...kids running around
with me on their sweaters...

489
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:12,705
Big Halloween item.

490
00:55:12,913 --> 00:55:15,711
I don't know, I guess I've become
something of an icon.

491
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:20,580
Like yesterday, they kept screaming,
"Spider-Man, Spider-Man."

492
00:55:21,455 --> 00:55:24,822
I don't know, you know, I mean,
I'm thinking to myself:

493
00:55:25,025 --> 00:55:28,927
"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens.
Do I deserve this?"

494
00:55:31,065 --> 00:55:32,327
Hi, Pete.

495
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,800
Hi.

496
00:55:41,709 --> 00:55:44,542
Hi, my parents and I
were just having dinner here.

497
00:55:44,745 --> 00:55:47,407
- Hello. I'm Gwen Stacy.
- Hi.

498
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:50,013
This is Mary Jane Watson.

499
00:55:51,452 --> 00:55:55,388
Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you.
Pete talks about you all the time.

500
00:55:57,491 --> 00:56:01,450
Gwen is my lab partner
in Dr. Connors' class.

501
00:56:01,662 --> 00:56:04,756
Pete's something of a genius.
I'd be completely lost without him.

502
00:56:04,965 --> 00:56:06,865
Which actually reminds me...

503
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:10,195
...Pete, if you've got a picture
of my kiss with Spider-Man...

504
00:56:10,404 --> 00:56:12,599
...could you bring it to class?

505
00:56:12,806 --> 00:56:16,970
I'd really love it. For my portfolio.

506
00:56:17,177 --> 00:56:20,078
After all,
who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right?

507
00:56:20,814 --> 00:56:22,577
I can't imagine.

508
00:56:23,784 --> 00:56:26,446
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

509
00:56:27,354 --> 00:56:28,912
- Good night.
- Good night.

510
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,100
Oh, she's in my science class.

511
00:56:42,303 --> 00:56:44,168
It's not her best subject.

512
00:56:46,674 --> 00:56:47,732
What?

513
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:50,172
How come
you never mentioned her?

514
00:56:51,612 --> 00:56:53,978
She's your lab partner?

515
00:56:54,181 --> 00:56:56,274
You saved her life?

516
00:56:56,483 --> 00:56:57,780
She thinks you're a genius...

517
00:56:57,985 --> 00:57:01,318
...and she had her
polished fingernails all over you?

518
00:57:01,522 --> 00:57:02,989
Or didn't you notice?

519
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:07,719
And she gave Spider-Man
the key to the city.

520
00:57:09,029 --> 00:57:10,997
I'll never forget that.

521
00:57:14,702 --> 00:57:16,101
She's just a girl in my class.

522
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:18,032
Let me ask you something.

523
00:57:18,238 --> 00:57:20,206
When you kissed her...

524
00:57:20,407 --> 00:57:22,773
...who was kissing her?

525
00:57:22,977 --> 00:57:25,639
Spider-Man or Peter?

526
00:57:25,879 --> 00:57:28,746
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

527
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:31,247
That was our kiss.

528
00:57:31,452 --> 00:57:32,942
Why would you do that?

529
00:57:33,921 --> 00:57:36,981
You must have known
how it'd make me feel.

530
00:57:37,524 --> 00:57:40,982
- Do you wanna push me away?
- Push you away?

531
00:57:41,195 --> 00:57:43,720
Why would I wanna push you away?
I love you.

532
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:47,833
You're my girlfriend.
She's a girl in my class, M.J.

533
00:57:49,336 --> 00:57:51,463
I don't feel well.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

534
00:57:51,672 --> 00:57:52,730
No, w...

535
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:57,242
- Where are you going?
- Please, don't follow me.

536
00:58:00,547 --> 00:58:02,037
Here we are.

537
00:58:38,552 --> 00:58:41,612
Hi, it's M.J.
Sing your song at the beep.

538
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,455
Hello.

539
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:50,857
I wish you'd pick up the phone.
I don't know what's going on or...

540
00:58:51,065 --> 00:58:54,034
I don't know if you
got the messages or what.

541
00:58:54,601 --> 00:58:55,727
But...

542
00:58:57,004 --> 00:58:59,734
...I just wanna talk to you.

543
00:59:00,941 --> 00:59:03,273
Okay, call me. Bye.

544
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:16,188
- Hello?
- Mr. Parker?

545
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,482
Yeah?

546
00:59:17,691 --> 00:59:20,125
This is Detective Neil Garrett
from the 32nd Precinct.

547
00:59:20,327 --> 00:59:22,056
I'm calling on behalf
of Captain Stacy.

548
00:59:22,262 --> 00:59:24,662
He would like you
to come down to the station.

549
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:28,301
Originally, we thought that this man,
Dennis Carradine...

550
00:59:28,502 --> 00:59:30,367
...was your husband's killer.

551
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:32,398
We were wrong.

552
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:33,998
What?

553
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:36,972
Turns out Mr. Carradine
was only an accomplice.

554
00:59:37,177 --> 00:59:39,577
The actual killer is still at large.

555
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,441
What are you talking about?

556
00:59:41,648 --> 00:59:44,048
This is the man
who killed your husband.

557
00:59:49,022 --> 00:59:50,182
His name is Flint Marko.

558
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:53,359
He's a small-time crook
who's been in and out of prison.

559
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,959
You got this wrong.

560
00:59:55,162 --> 00:59:56,356
Two days ago he escaped.

561
00:59:57,331 --> 00:59:59,856
Evidently, he confessed his guilt
to a cellmate...

562
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:03,833
...and we have a couple of witnesses
who will corroborate the story.

563
01:00:16,049 --> 01:00:18,540
No, wait, son.
You don't wanna do this.

564
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:23,117
No!

565
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:34,828
Hey, get in! What are you doing?

566
01:00:53,687 --> 01:00:55,518
Would you put these photos away,
please?

567
01:00:55,722 --> 01:00:57,952
I'm sorry, Mrs. Parker.
I know this isn't easy...

568
01:00:58,158 --> 01:01:00,558
...but, please, be patient with us.

569
01:01:00,761 --> 01:01:02,592
We're doing our job.
We will catch him.

570
01:01:02,796 --> 01:01:04,388
No, you're not doing your job.

571
01:01:04,598 --> 01:01:07,362
I watched my uncle die,
and we chased down the wrong man.

572
01:01:07,568 --> 01:01:10,594
Now you're telling me you had
suspicions for two years? Witnesses?

573
01:01:10,804 --> 01:01:12,931
- Why weren't we told about this?
- Settle down.

574
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,835
I have no intention of settling down.

575
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:17,602
This man killed my uncle,
and he's still out there!

576
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,110
L-20 Parkway.

577
01:01:28,322 --> 01:01:30,722
All officers in the vicinity,
please report.

578
01:01:31,124 --> 01:01:32,557
We have an abandoned vehicle...

579
01:01:32,759 --> 01:01:34,989
...and an elderly man
in the middle of the street.

580
01:01:35,195 --> 01:01:37,493
Sorry, Wabash Avenue.

581
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:41,761
Peter, it's M.J.

582
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:45,229
I'm not here about
what happened at dinner.

583
01:01:45,439 --> 01:01:46,633
Just please open up.

584
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:56,649
Aunt May called me.
She told me about what happened.

585
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:58,442
She's worried about you.

586
01:01:59,253 --> 01:02:00,652
I'm worried about you.

587
01:02:00,854 --> 01:02:02,321
Don't be. I'm fine.

588
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,855
I don't want you
to do something stupid.

589
01:02:05,058 --> 01:02:07,458
Like try to find my uncle's killer?

590
01:02:07,661 --> 01:02:10,095
And do something you'll regret.

591
01:02:10,297 --> 01:02:13,164
Like with that other guy.

592
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:17,030
He had a gun on me. I made a move
and he fell. I told you that.

593
01:02:17,237 --> 01:02:20,434
- I'm not accusing you of anything.
- 10-22, auto at 556...

594
01:02:20,641 --> 01:02:24,543
- Will you turn that thing off?
- Crossing 5-6 to 5-7.

595
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:29,546
Yeah, Central, this is Car 3-9
responding to your Sixth Avenue call.

596
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:33,117
Peter, I'm here
because I care about you.

597
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,812
And I know that you made a mistake
and that you feel guilty...

598
01:02:37,024 --> 01:02:40,516
...but I wanna be here for you.

599
01:02:40,727 --> 01:02:43,821
Okay. I get it. Thank you.

600
01:02:44,031 --> 01:02:46,625
But I'm fine. L...

601
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:48,630
I don't need your help.

602
01:02:56,076 --> 01:02:58,909
Everybody needs help sometimes,
Peter.

603
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:00,909
Even Spider-Man.

604
01:03:09,189 --> 01:03:11,817
Ninety X-ray, 98.

605
01:03:13,627 --> 01:03:18,291
Two-four King, respond to 1031
at 642 Madison Ave.

606
01:03:18,498 --> 01:03:23,367
One-three Thomas, respond to 1020
at 540 East 107.

607
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:27,404
Male complainant inside apartment.
May be on first floor.

608
01:03:30,844 --> 01:03:34,712
Three Henry 10-11,
I have a residence. 73818...

609
01:04:34,551 --> 01:04:36,246
Don't hurt me.
Just give me a chance!

610
01:04:36,453 --> 01:04:39,354
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance?

611
01:04:39,556 --> 01:04:40,648
Did you?

612
01:04:52,902 --> 01:04:54,699
Where am I?

613
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,581
What is this?

614
01:05:14,891 --> 01:05:16,449
I feel...

615
01:05:21,131 --> 01:05:23,258
This feels good.

616
01:05:35,311 --> 01:05:37,074
Yeah!

617
01:05:53,363 --> 01:05:54,921
This is something else.

618
01:05:57,066 --> 01:05:58,294
What do you think?

619
01:05:58,501 --> 01:06:00,560
I've never seen anything like it.

620
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:02,567
I'm a physicist, not a biologist...

621
01:06:02,772 --> 01:06:05,434
...but let me look at it in the morning.
Run some tests.

622
01:06:05,642 --> 01:06:06,802
Can we do that now?

623
01:06:11,714 --> 01:06:13,944
It seems to like you.

624
01:06:16,486 --> 01:06:19,046
- Don't let any of that get on you.
- Why not?

625
01:06:19,255 --> 01:06:21,780
It has the characteristics
of a symbiote...

626
01:06:21,991 --> 01:06:25,085
...which needs to bond
to a host to survive.

627
01:06:25,295 --> 01:06:28,822
And sometimes these things in nature,
when they bind...

628
01:06:29,032 --> 01:06:31,432
...they can be hard to unbind.

629
01:06:32,902 --> 01:06:36,633
Bank robbery in progress,
First Eastern Bank at 202 Bismark.

630
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,365
Another sandstorm
is reported in the vicinity.

631
01:06:39,576 --> 01:06:42,602
- All cars proceed with caution.
- Marko.

632
01:07:37,534 --> 01:07:39,900
Buddy, love the new outfit.

633
01:07:40,103 --> 01:07:42,094
This is exactly what I need
to scoop Parker.

634
01:07:42,305 --> 01:07:44,034
Give some of that web action.

635
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:47,934
See you, chump.

636
01:07:49,512 --> 01:07:51,275
What the hell?

637
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:34,714
Flint Marko.

638
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:40,561
- What do you want from me?
- Remember Ben Parker?

639
01:08:41,364 --> 01:08:44,356
The old man you shot down
in cold blood?

640
01:08:45,835 --> 01:08:47,598
What does it matter to you, anyway?

641
01:08:49,339 --> 01:08:50,738
Everything!

642
01:09:28,478 --> 01:09:30,776
It's time to pay, Marko!

643
01:10:40,783 --> 01:10:42,717
Good riddance.

644
01:11:03,706 --> 01:11:06,300
- Rent.
- Not now.

645
01:11:06,609 --> 01:11:09,271
Listen, it's a free country.
It's not rent-free country.

646
01:11:09,712 --> 01:11:11,612
- Leave me alone.
- Give me rent.

647
01:11:11,814 --> 01:11:14,783
You'll get your rent
when you fix this damn door!

648
01:11:25,962 --> 01:11:27,896
That wasn't cool.

649
01:11:28,264 --> 01:11:32,291
He is a good boy.

650
01:11:34,036 --> 01:11:35,936
He must be in some kind of trouble.

651
01:12:24,086 --> 01:12:27,351
Flint Marko,
the man who killed Uncle Ben...

652
01:12:28,357 --> 01:12:30,723
...he was killed last night.

653
01:12:30,927 --> 01:12:32,394
Oh, my.

654
01:12:33,229 --> 01:12:34,229
What happened?

655
01:12:34,864 --> 01:12:36,297
Spider-Man killed him.

656
01:12:38,234 --> 01:12:39,394
Spider-Man?

657
01:12:40,269 --> 01:12:42,294
I don't understand.

658
01:12:42,505 --> 01:12:45,167
Spider-Man doesn't kill people.

659
01:12:46,776 --> 01:12:48,641
What happened?

660
01:12:51,347 --> 01:12:53,076
I...

661
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:55,281
He...

662
01:12:55,985 --> 01:12:57,612
He was...

663
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:04,658
I thought that you'd feel...

664
01:13:07,296 --> 01:13:09,196
He deserved it, didn't he?

665
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:11,594
I don't think it's for us to say...

666
01:13:11,801 --> 01:13:15,737
...whether a person deserves
to live or die.

667
01:13:16,372 --> 01:13:19,034
But, Aunt May, he killed Uncle Ben.

668
01:13:19,242 --> 01:13:21,733
Uncle Ben meant the world to us.

669
01:13:21,944 --> 01:13:25,311
But he wouldn't want us living
one second...

670
01:13:25,514 --> 01:13:28,176
...with revenge in our hearts.

671
01:13:30,653 --> 01:13:33,053
It's like a poison. It can...

672
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:35,983
It can take you over.

673
01:13:37,894 --> 01:13:42,854
Before you know it,
turn us into something ugly.

674
01:13:56,812 --> 01:13:59,542
- He said it was a good idea.
- Yeah.

675
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,652
Hello?

676
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:47,385
Hey, Harry, it's M.J.

677
01:14:47,596 --> 01:14:48,620
Hi.

678
01:14:48,831 --> 01:14:50,230
I need some company.

679
01:14:50,433 --> 01:14:52,833
Are you doing anything?
Can I stop by?

680
01:14:53,035 --> 01:14:55,060
Yeah, sure, come on over.

681
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:57,535
Okay. Are you sure it's okay?

682
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:00,300
No, I'm not doing anything.
Please, come over.

683
01:15:00,509 --> 01:15:03,137
- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- Great.

684
01:15:03,346 --> 01:15:04,745
Bye.

685
01:15:05,748 --> 01:15:07,909
- Bernard.
- Yes, Mr. Osborn?

686
01:15:08,117 --> 01:15:10,312
We're having a guest.
Can you get some food?

687
01:15:10,519 --> 01:15:12,680
- A guest?
- Yeah, a guest.

688
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:16,221
- A "guest" guest?
- Will you just get some food?

689
01:15:16,425 --> 01:15:18,052
Right away, sir.

690
01:15:34,944 --> 01:15:37,845
Hey, Mr. Ditkovitch.

691
01:15:38,581 --> 01:15:41,345
- An orange?
- No, thanks.

692
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:45,316
Listen, I'm really sorry
for what happened earlier.

693
01:15:45,521 --> 01:15:48,922
I shouldn't have yelled about that door.
It was nothing to be angry about.

694
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:50,990
It's no big deal.

695
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:55,287
But if you feel that bad about it,
you can buy me pizza sometime.

696
01:15:55,498 --> 01:15:58,592
- Today's good.
- Okay.

697
01:15:58,801 --> 01:16:01,429
- Have problem with the phone?
- No, no. I was just...

698
01:16:01,637 --> 01:16:03,662
Well, I was trying
to figure out what to say.

699
01:16:03,873 --> 01:16:07,570
If it's a woman you're calling,
then you say:

700
01:16:07,777 --> 01:16:11,110
"You're a good woman.
I am good man."

701
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:18,082
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi.

702
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:19,413
He's calling a woman.

703
01:16:19,622 --> 01:16:21,522
Mary Jane?
I think that would be so good...

704
01:16:21,724 --> 01:16:25,683
This is none of your business.
Go. Go. Call.

705
01:16:27,496 --> 01:16:30,021
- You should call.
- Thanks.

706
01:16:32,535 --> 01:16:34,765
- Bye.
- Bye.

707
01:16:48,517 --> 01:16:49,643
Hi.

708
01:16:52,822 --> 01:16:55,256
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

709
01:16:56,425 --> 01:16:57,892
Come on.

710
01:17:02,064 --> 01:17:04,328
- I hope you like peppers.
- I love them.

711
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:30,153
No. Please.

712
01:17:41,504 --> 01:17:43,472
Oh, the butter.

713
01:17:53,616 --> 01:17:55,208
Beautiful.

714
01:17:59,788 --> 01:18:01,449
Check this out.

715
01:18:08,664 --> 01:18:10,928
Well, we can use that part.

716
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:14,735
You've been dreaming.

717
01:18:14,937 --> 01:18:18,100
Nothing like a little self-deception
to get you through the night.

718
01:18:18,307 --> 01:18:21,105
- All right.
- When did you write that?

719
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:24,074
- Twelfth grade.
- It's intense.

720
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,909
- So you want the part?
- I'd love to be in your play.

721
01:18:28,117 --> 01:18:29,607
It's yours.

722
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:35,019
You know, there's not even a scar.

723
01:18:36,659 --> 01:18:38,286
Barely.

724
01:18:55,811 --> 01:18:57,301
- Sorry.
- Me too.

725
01:18:57,513 --> 01:19:01,574
- I didn't mean to do that.
- No, it's okay. Please, forgive me.

726
01:19:03,018 --> 01:19:04,645
Mary Jane.

727
01:19:05,588 --> 01:19:07,317
Mary Jane.

728
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:10,853
- Mary Jane, please.
- I'm sorry.

729
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:12,590
Just...

730
01:19:24,707 --> 01:19:28,108
You've taken your eye off the ball.

731
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:35,782
Harry.

732
01:19:48,864 --> 01:19:50,092
What have you done?

733
01:19:52,835 --> 01:19:54,302
Avenge me!

734
01:19:57,539 --> 01:20:01,566
- My father, he died, right?
- Yeah.

735
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:03,938
Just wish I could remember
more about him.

736
01:20:04,146 --> 01:20:07,138
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.

737
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:10,409
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

738
01:20:11,287 --> 01:20:12,914
Harry.

739
01:20:14,757 --> 01:20:16,691
Remember me?

740
01:20:18,594 --> 01:20:21,427
Yes, Father. I remember.

741
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:24,895
I was right about her. About Peter.

742
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,261
About everything.

743
01:20:28,737 --> 01:20:32,468
You know what you must do.
Make him suffer.

744
01:20:32,675 --> 01:20:34,973
Make him wish he were dead.

745
01:20:35,177 --> 01:20:39,011
First, we attack his heart.

746
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:52,260
Hi, it's me.
Sing your song at the beep.

747
01:20:52,461 --> 01:20:55,259
Hey, M.J. It's Peter.

748
01:20:57,333 --> 01:21:00,200
I wanna talk to you about last night.

749
01:21:01,003 --> 01:21:03,096
I don't know what I was thinking.

750
01:21:03,305 --> 01:21:08,072
I know you were just there
to help and I...

751
01:21:08,277 --> 01:21:11,212
I don't know. I wanna see you.

752
01:21:15,784 --> 01:21:19,481
If you want Peter to live,
you're gonna do something for me.

753
01:21:23,759 --> 01:21:25,249
- Yeah?
- It's Ursula.

754
01:21:25,461 --> 01:21:27,122
Come in.

755
01:21:35,904 --> 01:21:37,565
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi.

756
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:39,934
There's a phone call for you.

757
01:21:41,377 --> 01:21:43,004
It's Mary Jane, she called back.

758
01:21:43,212 --> 01:21:45,146
- Really?
- Yeah.

759
01:21:46,915 --> 01:21:52,376
- I put the phone on top of the thing.
- Thanks. Okay.

760
01:21:54,523 --> 01:21:56,047
- Hey.
- Hi.

761
01:21:56,258 --> 01:21:58,886
Oh, I'm so glad you called.
I've been trying to...

762
01:21:59,094 --> 01:22:01,858
- Can you meet me?
- You bet.

763
01:22:02,064 --> 01:22:04,430
- Now?
- Okay. Where?

764
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:06,464
At the bridge in the park.

765
01:22:06,668 --> 01:22:07,965
- On my way.
- Okay.

766
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:11,105
Okay. Hey. I love you.

767
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:32,483
You look beautiful.

768
01:22:33,862 --> 01:22:35,352
Peonies.

769
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:40,494
- You okay?
- No.

770
01:22:41,503 --> 01:22:43,494
There's something
I have to tell you, Pete.

771
01:22:44,072 --> 01:22:45,471
Okay.

772
01:22:46,775 --> 01:22:48,367
It's not working.

773
01:22:49,478 --> 01:22:51,036
You and me.

774
01:22:52,214 --> 01:22:53,545
What?

775
01:22:53,949 --> 01:22:56,247
I don't wanna see you anymore.

776
01:22:56,885 --> 01:22:58,648
What are you talking about?

777
01:22:58,854 --> 01:23:00,879
I don't know.

778
01:23:03,659 --> 01:23:05,388
I'm lonely.

779
01:23:06,662 --> 01:23:08,857
You aren't there for me.

780
01:23:10,032 --> 01:23:12,432
I can't do this.

781
01:23:12,634 --> 01:23:18,368
- It's over.
- No. Please. Please don't say that.

782
01:23:18,907 --> 01:23:21,671
I know I've been selfish,
but I can do better. I can change.

783
01:23:21,877 --> 01:23:25,540
- It's not that simple.
- We love each other. I love you.

784
01:23:25,747 --> 01:23:27,806
We have problems.
When people have problems...

785
01:23:28,016 --> 01:23:30,712
...they work it out.
They talk to each other.

786
01:23:35,824 --> 01:23:37,519
Look, you see?

787
01:23:38,794 --> 01:23:40,785
You know what this is?

788
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:45,193
- You know what I want for us?
- There's someone else.

789
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,164
I've fallen in love
with someone else.

790
01:24:09,892 --> 01:24:11,382
Bravo.

791
01:24:21,503 --> 01:24:25,735
She says that she's lonely,
that I'm not there for her.

792
01:24:27,276 --> 01:24:29,506
There's another guy.

793
01:24:32,514 --> 01:24:34,277
Well, how you holding up?

794
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:36,711
Not good.

795
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:41,687
Harry, I was gonna propose to her.

796
01:24:42,391 --> 01:24:43,858
Really?

797
01:24:46,161 --> 01:24:50,063
Well, she's been going through
a tough time lately. Career.

798
01:24:50,265 --> 01:24:53,063
I mean, a singing waitress
at a jazz club?

799
01:24:53,268 --> 01:24:56,237
It's not exactly
what she had in mind for herself.

800
01:24:56,438 --> 01:24:59,498
Singing waitress? What are you...?
What are you talking about?

801
01:24:59,708 --> 01:25:04,202
Well, she was fired from the show.
Didn't she tell you?

802
01:25:04,613 --> 01:25:05,978
She was fired?

803
01:25:07,683 --> 01:25:12,780
She was fired and she told you?
She didn't tell me?

804
01:25:14,456 --> 01:25:16,890
Well, that's why
I asked you here, Pete.

805
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,128
I'm the other guy.

806
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:23,725
What?

807
01:25:23,932 --> 01:25:26,901
Look, she came to me
one afternoon, troubled.

808
01:25:27,102 --> 01:25:29,969
She needed someone
and I was there for her.

809
01:25:30,872 --> 01:25:33,898
I've always loved her, Pete.
You know that.

810
01:25:34,109 --> 01:25:35,872
It just...

811
01:25:36,078 --> 01:25:38,069
...started.

812
01:25:45,487 --> 01:25:48,752
I don't believe this.
I don't... I don't believe you.

813
01:25:48,957 --> 01:25:51,289
Look, I'm really sorry.

814
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:55,193
I just thought you should know.

815
01:26:03,405 --> 01:26:06,738
- Can I warm you up?
- Yes, please.

816
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:09,877
How's the pie?

817
01:26:10,946 --> 01:26:12,573
So good.

818
01:27:15,977 --> 01:27:17,740
Would you like a drink?

819
01:27:20,615 --> 01:27:23,106
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

820
01:27:23,318 --> 01:27:25,809
Bad for the public image, right,
Mr. Key-to-the-City?

821
01:27:26,021 --> 01:27:27,249
What did you do to her?

822
01:27:29,424 --> 01:27:32,120
I did what you failed to do.
I was there for her.

823
01:27:33,061 --> 01:27:35,188
Mary Jane and I,
we understand each other.

824
01:27:35,397 --> 01:27:40,357
- She doesn't know what you are.
- Peter, she knows me very well.

825
01:27:40,569 --> 01:27:44,699
And when she kissed me,
it was just like she used to kiss me.

826
01:27:45,207 --> 01:27:46,868
That taste...

827
01:27:48,543 --> 01:27:49,771
Strawberries.

828
01:28:25,447 --> 01:28:26,971
How'd you like that, Spidey?

829
01:28:30,852 --> 01:28:32,149
That all you got?

830
01:28:39,461 --> 01:28:41,952
- Stings, doesn't it?
- I protected you in high school.

831
01:28:42,164 --> 01:28:44,359
Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.

832
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,545
Gonna kill me
like you killed my father?

833
01:29:33,748 --> 01:29:35,875
I'm done trying to convince you.

834
01:29:36,718 --> 01:29:40,154
You took him from me. He loved me.

835
01:29:40,355 --> 01:29:44,223
No. He despised you.

836
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:46,621
You were an embarrassment to him.

837
01:29:50,465 --> 01:29:54,231
Look at little Goblin Junior.
Gonna cry?

838
01:30:31,172 --> 01:30:33,367
Spider-Man used to
make me feel safe.

839
01:30:33,575 --> 01:30:35,475
Now I'm afraid
to walk home from work.

840
01:30:35,677 --> 01:30:39,306
- My son thought the world of this guy.
- I have a daughter, loves Spider-Man.

841
01:30:39,514 --> 01:30:42,711
- Who's she to look up to?
- This is the guy they gave the key to?

842
01:30:44,085 --> 01:30:46,883
I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.

843
01:30:48,924 --> 01:30:52,052
- Cheers to the new staff photographer.
- Hey, I just got lucky.

844
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:53,955
This is so wonderful for you.

845
01:30:54,162 --> 01:30:57,757
Well, you might wanna tell J.J.
To make a little more wall space.

846
01:31:02,904 --> 01:31:06,271
Wow, good morning.
It's a beautiful day, huh?

847
01:31:06,474 --> 01:31:08,908
What was it you said?
I'll never get that picture?

848
01:31:09,711 --> 01:31:11,440
There's your hero.

849
01:31:13,048 --> 01:31:16,540
- I never thought he'd really do that.
- See? Right there.

850
01:31:16,751 --> 01:31:19,345
You made a judgment call.
You gotta see it as it is.

851
01:31:19,554 --> 01:31:20,885
Funny you should say that...

852
01:31:21,089 --> 01:31:25,287
...because I was looking through
some old photos and it looks very...

853
01:31:25,493 --> 01:31:27,290
...similar.

854
01:31:28,463 --> 01:31:31,364
Okay. Well, I gotta get back to work.

855
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,535
- You're trash, Brock.
- Excuse me?

856
01:31:35,737 --> 01:31:37,637
Your picture's a fake.

857
01:31:39,641 --> 01:31:42,769
Oh, Parker,
you are such a boy scout.

858
01:31:42,978 --> 01:31:44,946
When are you gonna
give a guy a break?

859
01:31:47,048 --> 01:31:49,209
You want forgiveness? Get religion.

860
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:52,944
- What's going on here?
- Are you guys all right?

861
01:31:56,157 --> 01:31:59,649
Yeah. No, we...
We're just horsing around.

862
01:32:00,161 --> 01:32:04,154
Look, I'm begging you.
If you do this, I will lose everything.

863
01:32:04,366 --> 01:32:06,596
There's not a paper in town
that will hire me.

864
01:32:06,801 --> 01:32:09,099
You should've
thought of that earlier.

865
01:32:09,838 --> 01:32:12,033
What are you doing, Peter?

866
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:16,438
Show this to your editor.
Tell him to check his source next time.

867
01:32:22,617 --> 01:32:24,175
It's a fake.

868
01:32:24,386 --> 01:32:28,322
Empire State
Photographic Department confirms it.

869
01:32:31,993 --> 01:32:33,824
Pack your things.
Get out of my building.

870
01:32:34,362 --> 01:32:36,455
- I was just trying...
- You're fired.

871
01:32:38,099 --> 01:32:40,329
We're gonna have to
print a retraction now.

872
01:32:40,568 --> 01:32:42,593
I haven't printed a retraction
in 20 years.

873
01:32:48,810 --> 01:32:51,404
- Hello.
- Mr. Parker, Dr. Connors here.

874
01:32:51,613 --> 01:32:55,709
Oh, Dr. Connors. How are you?

875
01:32:55,917 --> 01:32:59,080
Quite a specimen
you left me, Parker.

876
01:32:59,554 --> 01:33:04,014
Its chemistry is not unlike
the chondritic meteorites of the '70s.

877
01:33:04,225 --> 01:33:05,385
Thanks.

878
01:33:05,593 --> 01:33:08,084
- That's good.
- You know what, Parker?

879
01:33:10,065 --> 01:33:12,829
- Parker?
- Get me some milk.

880
01:33:13,635 --> 01:33:17,162
It amplifies characteristics
of its host.

881
01:33:17,372 --> 01:33:21,035
- Hey, give me another cookie.
- Especially aggression.

882
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:23,975
This could be dangerous.

883
01:33:24,179 --> 01:33:27,637
Peter, you didn't keep any, did you?

884
01:33:27,849 --> 01:33:31,512
- You got any with nuts?
- I have some nuts. I could make some.

885
01:33:31,719 --> 01:33:33,380
- Go make me some.
- Peter?

886
01:33:33,588 --> 01:33:36,079
No, no, no. Course not.

887
01:33:50,538 --> 01:33:52,369
These shots are so good.

888
01:33:52,574 --> 01:33:55,065
I'd love to shoot you sometime.

889
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:58,977
Peter Parker. Peter.

890
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:03,446
Parker. Miss Brant, that's not
the position I hired you for.

891
01:34:03,651 --> 01:34:05,175
Black-suit Spider-Man.

892
01:34:06,654 --> 01:34:08,781
Peter, these are incredible.

893
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:11,823
- We gotta have these, Jonah.
- I'll pay you the usual rate.

894
01:34:13,828 --> 01:34:16,422
If you want the shots,
I'll take the staff job...

895
01:34:16,631 --> 01:34:18,428
...double the money.

896
01:35:43,585 --> 01:35:44,984
Penny.

897
01:35:51,059 --> 01:35:53,687
You are really gonna dig this joint.

898
01:35:55,029 --> 01:35:57,020
Do you think I'm...?
I'm dressed all right?

899
01:35:57,232 --> 01:35:58,756
Too fancy or too...

900
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:02,960
Are you kidding me?
You're looking fine, babe.

901
01:36:03,171 --> 01:36:06,868
- Thank you.
- Love that little giggle.

902
01:36:09,677 --> 01:36:11,577
Hey, keep it open there, pops.

903
01:36:14,882 --> 01:36:18,318
Oh, this is so cool.

904
01:36:18,519 --> 01:36:21,181
I have never been
to a jazz club before.

905
01:36:24,025 --> 01:36:27,358
Oh, I hope we can get a table.

906
01:36:32,133 --> 01:36:34,533
Find us some shade.

907
01:36:35,703 --> 01:36:37,796
Thanks, hot legs.

908
01:36:38,206 --> 01:36:40,674
Right this way, sir.

909
01:36:48,116 --> 01:36:50,141
Oh, why, thank you.

910
01:36:55,423 --> 01:36:59,325
- I am so loving this.
- Oh, me too.

911
01:37:04,932 --> 01:37:08,390
- Isn't that your old girlfriend?
- Yeah.

912
01:37:08,603 --> 01:37:12,903
- Do you wanna go some place else?
- Oh, no, no. I'll... I'll be okay.

913
01:37:13,107 --> 01:37:15,940
- Mary Jane, show us what you got.
- I'll take that.

914
01:37:21,649 --> 01:37:24,743
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

915
01:37:33,828 --> 01:37:34,954
Peter?

916
01:37:38,099 --> 01:37:40,033
This is for you.

917
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:47,267
Double-time.

918
01:37:52,447 --> 01:37:54,108
Thanks.

919
01:38:20,875 --> 01:38:22,706
Now dig on this.

920
01:38:24,011 --> 01:38:25,171
That is hot.

921
01:39:06,354 --> 01:39:08,049
That was all for her?

922
01:39:16,764 --> 01:39:18,231
I'm so sorry.

923
01:39:30,711 --> 01:39:33,145
- You all right, Mary Jane?
- I'm fine.

924
01:39:33,347 --> 01:39:34,746
Okay.

925
01:39:37,752 --> 01:39:39,151
Hey.

926
01:39:41,389 --> 01:39:42,651
What's wrong with you?

927
01:39:43,991 --> 01:39:45,390
You.

928
01:39:45,893 --> 01:39:48,885
- Can I help you, sir?
- No.

929
01:39:49,096 --> 01:39:51,121
Is everything okay here, Paul?

930
01:39:51,332 --> 01:39:53,527
Yeah, is everything okay here, Paul?

931
01:39:53,734 --> 01:39:56,100
- Take him out of here.
- Let's go, sir.

932
01:39:56,304 --> 01:39:59,068
- Take your hand off of me.
- Now.

933
01:39:59,273 --> 01:40:02,674
- Okay.
- Hey, get off. Let go.

934
01:40:05,246 --> 01:40:06,907
Peter, stop it!

935
01:40:18,459 --> 01:40:19,824
Who are you?

936
01:40:22,396 --> 01:40:23,920
I don't know.

937
01:41:56,624 --> 01:41:58,489
It's Brock, sir.

938
01:41:58,693 --> 01:42:01,127
Edward Brock Jr.

939
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:05,424
I come before you today...

940
01:42:07,001 --> 01:42:08,593
...humbled...

941
01:42:10,504 --> 01:42:12,597
...and humiliated...

942
01:42:15,476 --> 01:42:17,637
...to ask you for one thing.

943
01:42:23,351 --> 01:42:25,114
I want you to kill Peter Parker.

944
01:43:16,203 --> 01:43:17,203
Parker.

945
01:45:01,275 --> 01:45:03,436
- Hi, Peter.
- Hi.

946
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:10,344
You don't seem to have changed
the room around very much.

947
01:45:10,818 --> 01:45:15,050
Of course, there's not much
you could do, is there?

948
01:45:21,362 --> 01:45:23,557
When we spoke on the phone...

949
01:45:23,764 --> 01:45:26,198
...I sensed that something
was bothering you...

950
01:45:26,934 --> 01:45:30,301
...so I thought I'd just come by.

951
01:45:32,606 --> 01:45:35,074
How's Mary Jane?

952
01:45:35,509 --> 01:45:37,204
I don't know.

953
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:42,048
I never heard from you.

954
01:45:42,249 --> 01:45:44,740
Did you ever propose?

955
01:45:48,789 --> 01:45:50,416
You said...

956
01:45:51,425 --> 01:45:54,826
...a husband's gotta put a wife
before himself.

957
01:46:00,167 --> 01:46:02,067
I'm not ready.

958
01:46:04,405 --> 01:46:06,464
But what happened?

959
01:46:07,374 --> 01:46:09,842
You seemed so sure.

960
01:46:11,145 --> 01:46:12,669
Yeah.

961
01:46:14,048 --> 01:46:15,675
I...

962
01:46:26,093 --> 01:46:28,323
I hurt her, Aunt May.

963
01:46:29,730 --> 01:46:31,721
I don't know what to do.

964
01:46:33,634 --> 01:46:37,400
Well, you start
by doing the hardest thing:

965
01:46:38,205 --> 01:46:41,140
You forgive yourself.

966
01:46:44,311 --> 01:46:46,802
I believe in you, Peter.

967
01:46:47,014 --> 01:46:49,847
You're a good person.

968
01:46:50,951 --> 01:46:55,786
And I know you will find a way
to put it right.

969
01:47:03,497 --> 01:47:05,294
In time.

970
01:47:23,417 --> 01:47:25,783
End of the line, Spider-Man.

971
01:47:29,857 --> 01:47:32,121
I want him dead too, Flint.

972
01:47:32,726 --> 01:47:34,990
That's why
I've been looking for you.

973
01:47:35,195 --> 01:47:38,426
Oh, yeah. I know all about you.

974
01:47:38,632 --> 01:47:42,830
Like the fact that Spider-Man
won't let you help your poor daughter.

975
01:47:43,037 --> 01:47:46,302
It's just...
That doesn't seem right to me.

976
01:47:46,507 --> 01:47:51,410
Look, I wanna kill the spider,
you wanna kill the spider.

977
01:47:51,612 --> 01:47:54,843
Together, he doesn't stand a chance.

978
01:47:55,916 --> 01:47:57,941
Interested?

979
01:47:59,353 --> 01:48:00,843
Yeah.

980
01:49:02,816 --> 01:49:03,816
So...

981
01:49:05,352 --> 01:49:06,580
...where to?

982
01:49:07,755 --> 01:49:09,450
All New York is holding its breath...

983
01:49:09,656 --> 01:49:12,250
...as the hostage crisis
continues to unfold.

984
01:49:14,028 --> 01:49:15,256
Just 30 minutes ago...

985
01:49:15,462 --> 01:49:17,521
...police came across
this startling sight:

986
01:49:17,731 --> 01:49:19,824
A young woman,
held hostage in a taxi...

987
01:49:20,034 --> 01:49:22,298
...suspended 80 stories
above the ground...

988
01:49:22,503 --> 01:49:25,336
...in what appears to be
a giant web.

989
01:49:25,539 --> 01:49:28,133
Every attempt by the police
to rescue the hostage...

990
01:49:28,342 --> 01:49:30,105
...has been thwarted
by the Sandman.

991
01:49:33,580 --> 01:49:34,808
Compounding the danger...

992
01:49:35,015 --> 01:49:37,882
...is the appearance
of a strange black-suited figure.

993
01:49:38,085 --> 01:49:41,714
Early reports had believed him
to be the black-suited Spider-Man...

994
01:49:41,922 --> 01:49:45,449
...but he has now been identified
as something entirely different.

995
01:49:47,127 --> 01:49:50,619
The hostage has been identified
as Mary Jane Watson...

996
01:49:50,831 --> 01:49:54,892
...an actress recently seen
in a brief stint on Broadway.

997
01:50:20,627 --> 01:50:22,993
We're now going to take you
live to the scene...

998
01:50:23,197 --> 01:50:24,858
...with Jennifer Dugan. Jennifer?

999
01:50:25,065 --> 01:50:27,556
We're only about
100 feet away now, Hal, and...

1000
01:50:27,768 --> 01:50:31,534
Wait. There seems to be
some kind of activity in the web.

1001
01:50:31,738 --> 01:50:35,265
They seem to be creating
some kind of gigantic lettering.

1002
01:50:38,312 --> 01:50:41,076
Spider-Man's being challenged
to some sort of confrontation.

1003
01:50:41,281 --> 01:50:42,908
And that raises serious questions...

1004
01:50:43,117 --> 01:50:46,280
...about what kind of chance he'd
stand against such overwhelming...

1005
01:50:56,830 --> 01:50:58,161
Harry?

1006
01:51:01,735 --> 01:51:03,703
I need your help.

1007
01:51:04,171 --> 01:51:07,504
I can't take them both,
not by myself.

1008
01:51:14,047 --> 01:51:16,811
You don't deserve my help.

1009
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:21,187
Harry...

1010
01:51:21,922 --> 01:51:23,913
...she needs us.

1011
01:51:28,529 --> 01:51:30,087
Get out.

1012
01:51:46,713 --> 01:51:48,908
If I may, sir?

1013
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:55,120
I've seen things in this house
I've never spoken of.

1014
01:51:55,622 --> 01:51:57,351
What are you trying to tell me?

1015
01:51:58,192 --> 01:52:00,888
The night your father died...

1016
01:52:01,094 --> 01:52:03,528
...I cleaned his wound.

1017
01:52:05,065 --> 01:52:08,626
The blade that pierced his body...

1018
01:52:08,835 --> 01:52:11,531
...came from his glider.

1019
01:52:12,406 --> 01:52:17,173
I know you're trying to defend
your father's honor...

1020
01:52:17,377 --> 01:52:22,576
...but there's no question
that he died by his own hand.

1021
01:52:25,886 --> 01:52:28,218
I loved your father...

1022
01:52:29,590 --> 01:52:32,491
...as I have loved you, Harry.

1023
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:35,958
As your friends love you.

1024
01:53:23,043 --> 01:53:24,271
Look.

1025
01:53:45,198 --> 01:53:48,656
Spider-Man! Spider-Man!
Spider-Man!

1026
01:53:54,241 --> 01:53:56,175
He seems to have
come out of nowhere...

1027
01:53:56,376 --> 01:53:58,344
...to answer the prayers of the city...

1028
01:53:58,545 --> 01:54:00,536
...just when all hope
seemed to be lost.

1029
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:09,387
Peter. They're gonna kill us both.

1030
01:54:09,589 --> 01:54:13,025
- I'm gonna get you out of this.
- Watch out.

1031
01:54:22,536 --> 01:54:23,935
Hey, Parker.

1032
01:54:24,137 --> 01:54:25,365
My God. Eddie.

1033
01:54:26,039 --> 01:54:27,734
My spider-sense is tingling...

1034
01:54:29,476 --> 01:54:32,172
...if you know what I'm talking about.

1035
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:53,129
We can find a way to settle this.

1036
01:54:53,333 --> 01:54:54,732
You're so right.

1037
01:54:54,935 --> 01:54:58,393
I'm thinking humiliation.

1038
01:54:59,139 --> 01:55:01,437
Kind of like how you humiliated me.

1039
01:55:02,342 --> 01:55:04,037
Do you remember?

1040
01:55:05,912 --> 01:55:08,676
Do you remember
what you did to me?

1041
01:55:24,197 --> 01:55:27,792
You made me lose my girl.
Now I'm gonna make you lose yours.

1042
01:55:29,669 --> 01:55:31,603
How's that sound, tiger?

1043
01:56:31,531 --> 01:56:33,158
Hold on, Mary Jane!

1044
01:57:03,363 --> 01:57:05,661
Mary Jane!

1045
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:09,890
It's hard to believe
what's happening.

1046
01:58:10,096 --> 01:58:12,394
The brutality of it.

1047
01:58:13,166 --> 01:58:14,929
I don't know how
he can take any more.

1048
01:58:15,135 --> 01:58:18,662
This could be a tragic day
for the people of New York.

1049
01:58:18,872 --> 01:58:20,840
It could be the end of Spider-Man.

1050
01:58:47,267 --> 01:58:49,462
- Awesome.
- Wicked cool.

1051
01:59:14,527 --> 01:59:15,960
You came.

1052
01:59:23,937 --> 01:59:25,962
Looks like just in the nick of time.

1053
01:59:26,172 --> 01:59:28,640
A couple minutes ago
wouldn't have been so bad either.

1054
01:59:28,842 --> 01:59:30,400
What are you gonna do?

1055
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:35,811
I may need some help over here.

1056
01:59:36,016 --> 01:59:38,416
I'm a little busy right now.

1057
01:59:39,586 --> 01:59:41,315
Give me your hand.

1058
01:59:55,802 --> 01:59:58,635
Parker! Parker, where...?

1059
01:59:58,838 --> 02:00:00,362
I need a photographer.

1060
02:00:00,573 --> 02:00:01,835
Hey, kid, you want a job?

1061
02:00:02,042 --> 02:00:05,341
Why would I want a job?
I'm just a kid.

1062
02:00:05,545 --> 02:00:08,412
- All right, how much for the camera?
- One hundred bucks.

1063
02:00:08,615 --> 02:00:10,048
A hundred bucks?

1064
02:00:11,985 --> 02:00:15,682
All right, you little crook. Here.

1065
02:00:17,457 --> 02:00:18,754
What the...?

1066
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:22,352
Film's extra.

1067
02:00:28,234 --> 02:00:29,997
Gotcha.

1068
02:00:38,044 --> 02:00:39,306
Pete, up top.

1069
02:00:59,165 --> 02:01:01,133
Mary Jane.

1070
02:01:03,369 --> 02:01:05,132
- This thing got any more?
- Hang on.

1071
02:01:05,338 --> 02:01:06,464
To what?

1072
02:01:10,910 --> 02:01:12,707
- Go, buddy.
- Got her.

1073
02:01:24,090 --> 02:01:25,090
You okay?

1074
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:28,750
Yeah.

1075
02:01:31,531 --> 02:01:33,897
- Good.
- Hey, Pete.

1076
02:01:36,236 --> 02:01:37,999
Am I interrupting?

1077
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:56,077
Never wound...

1078
02:02:56,983 --> 02:02:58,974
...what you can't kill.

1079
02:03:02,789 --> 02:03:06,281
Eddie, the suit,
you gotta take it off.

1080
02:03:06,492 --> 02:03:08,153
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

1081
02:03:11,097 --> 02:03:12,826
I know what it feels like.

1082
02:03:13,466 --> 02:03:15,058
It feels good.

1083
02:03:15,268 --> 02:03:17,759
The power. Everything.

1084
02:03:17,971 --> 02:03:20,439
But you'll lose yourself.

1085
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:22,905
Let it go.

1086
02:03:23,109 --> 02:03:25,100
I like being bad.

1087
02:03:26,279 --> 02:03:28,008
It makes me happy.

1088
02:04:17,530 --> 02:04:18,588
Harry!

1089
02:05:31,671 --> 02:05:33,969
Peter. What are you doing?

1090
02:05:34,974 --> 02:05:36,737
No!

1091
02:05:38,544 --> 02:05:39,544
Eddie!

1092
02:05:59,065 --> 02:06:00,999
- Harry.
- Mary Jane.

1093
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:02,997
- I'm gonna get help.
- No.

1094
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:05,235
Stay.

1095
02:06:14,013 --> 02:06:15,640
I didn't want this.

1096
02:06:20,553 --> 02:06:22,748
But I had no choice.

1097
02:06:26,526 --> 02:06:28,585
We always have a choice.

1098
02:06:28,795 --> 02:06:30,990
You had a choice
when you killed my uncle.

1099
02:06:33,533 --> 02:06:35,501
My daughter was dying.

1100
02:06:37,703 --> 02:06:39,534
I needed money.

1101
02:06:44,377 --> 02:06:46,277
I was scared.

1102
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:56,880
I told your uncle
all I wanted was the car.

1103
02:06:57,090 --> 02:06:58,990
- What is it?
- I need your car.

1104
02:06:59,559 --> 02:07:01,993
He said to me:

1105
02:07:02,195 --> 02:07:04,925
"Why don't you just put down the gun
and go home?"

1106
02:07:09,068 --> 02:07:12,003
I realize now
he was just trying to help me.

1107
02:07:18,778 --> 02:07:21,713
Then I saw my partner
running over with the cash.

1108
02:07:21,914 --> 02:07:24,212
And the gun was in my hand.

1109
02:07:34,727 --> 02:07:36,126
Get in.

1110
02:07:38,064 --> 02:07:40,396
Did a terrible thing to you...

1111
02:07:41,801 --> 02:07:45,168
...and I spent a lot of nights
wishing I could take it back.

1112
02:07:50,476 --> 02:07:53,001
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

1113
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:56,278
I just want you to understand.

1114
02:08:06,125 --> 02:08:08,685
I've done terrible things too.

1115
02:08:25,011 --> 02:08:27,741
I didn't choose to be this.

1116
02:08:36,522 --> 02:08:38,990
The only thing left of me now...

1117
02:08:41,194 --> 02:08:43,059
...is my daughter.

1118
02:08:55,341 --> 02:08:57,241
I forgive you.

1119
02:09:40,653 --> 02:09:43,554
Hey, pal. How you doing?

1120
02:09:43,756 --> 02:09:45,314
Been better.

1121
02:09:46,926 --> 02:09:48,826
We'll get you through this.

1122
02:09:52,598 --> 02:09:54,065
No.

1123
02:10:01,774 --> 02:10:03,901
I should never have hurt you...

1124
02:10:05,811 --> 02:10:08,075
...said those things.

1125
02:10:09,782 --> 02:10:12,273
None of that matters, Peter.

1126
02:10:14,387 --> 02:10:16,116
You're my friend.

1127
02:10:20,893 --> 02:10:22,656
Best friend.

1128
02:10:41,580 --> 02:10:43,207
Harry.

1129
02:11:29,261 --> 02:11:31,388
Whatever comes our way...

1130
02:11:32,498 --> 02:11:36,662
...whatever battle we have raging
inside us, we always have a choice.

1131
02:11:38,804 --> 02:11:40,863
My friend Harry taught me that.

1132
02:11:41,073 --> 02:11:44,270
He chose to be the best of himself.

1133
02:11:45,177 --> 02:11:48,146
It's the choices
that make us who we are...

1134
02:11:48,347 --> 02:11:51,714
...and we can always choose
to do what's right.
