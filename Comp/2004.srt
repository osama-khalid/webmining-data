1
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:02,135
She looks at me every day.

2
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:04,096
Mary Jane Watson.

3
00:03:04,263 --> 00:03:08,308
Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.

4
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:10,269
But she can never know.

5
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:13,856
I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.

6
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:16,358
A life she can never be a part of.

7
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:17,818
Who am I?

8
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:20,571
I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.

9
00:03:20,737 --> 00:03:23,740
And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.

10
00:03:23,907 --> 00:03:25,492
Parker. Parker!

11
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:27,870
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

12
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:31,999
Parker, you're late, man.
Always late, huh?

13
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:35,085
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

14
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:37,689
Disturbance. Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

15
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:40,507
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

16
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:44,094
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

17
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:47,306
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

18
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:50,392
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas,

19
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:53,228
but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

20
00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:56,815
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

21
00:03:56,982 --> 00:04:00,736
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

22
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:02,946
This is your last chance.

23
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:07,868
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.

24
00:04:09,578 --> 00:04:11,455
Go!

25
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:35,270
Hey, what, are you stupid?

26
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:57,167
Woo-hoo! Whoo!

27
00:04:57,376 --> 00:05:00,420
Whoa! He stole
that guy's pizzas!

28
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:10,722
I'm gonna get it!

29
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:28,657
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

30
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:30,385
- Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.
- Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

31
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:32,077
See you.

32
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:34,496
Way to go, Spidey!

33
00:06:27,382 --> 00:06:29,301
Pizza time.

34
00:06:34,056 --> 00:06:35,640
You're late.

35
00:06:36,558 --> 00:06:37,893
I'm not paying for those.

36
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:59,873
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

37
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:04,669
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

38
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:06,838
It's serious to me too,
Mr. Aziz.

39
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:09,424
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.

40
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:12,260
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.

41
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:22,687
You're fired.

42
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:25,107
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?

43
00:07:25,273 --> 00:07:26,733
Dogs catching Frisbees?

44
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,194
Pigeons in the park?
A couple of geezers playing chess?

45
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:30,612
- Boss.
- Not now.

46
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:33,633
I was thinking maybe the Bugle could show
another side of New York for a change.

47
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:36,618
We got six minutes to deadline,
Jonah. We need page one.

48
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:40,163
Parker, I don't pay you to be a sensitive
artiste. I pay you because-Still not now!

49
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,101
I pay you because, for some reason, that
psycho Spider-Man will pose for you.

50
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,645
Spider-Man won't let me take any more pictures.
You've turned the whole city against him.

51
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:48,296
A fact I'm very proud of.

52
00:07:48,463 --> 00:07:52,217
Now, get your pretty little portfolio off
my desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

53
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:54,529
Boss, your wife's on the line,
she says she lost her checkbook.

54
00:07:54,553 --> 00:07:55,762
Thanks for the good news.

55
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:59,449
Mr. Jameson, please, isn't there any of these
shots you can use? I really need the money.

56
00:07:59,516 --> 00:08:01,268
Awww. Miss Brant.

57
00:08:01,434 --> 00:08:02,769
- Yes?
- Get me a violin.

58
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:04,312
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

59
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,149
All right, run a picture of a rancid
chicken. Here's the headline:

60
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:09,192
"Food Poisoning Scare
Sweeps City."

61
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:11,736
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous, yeah.

62
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:13,780
All right, Mr. Jameson.

63
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,659
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

64
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:19,452
"Masked Menace
Terrorizes Town."

65
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:21,079
I told you, he's not a menace.

66
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:22,998
- And I told you.
- I'll take care of it.

67
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:24,749
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.

68
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,418
That's outrageous.

69
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:28,545
Done. Give this to the girl.

70
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:30,005
Thank you. Bye-bye.

71
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,882
Hi.

72
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:33,550
Hey, Pete.

73
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:39,764
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

74
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:42,684
- Oh, right.
- Sorry.

75
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,145
Hey.

76
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:47,189
Chin up, okay?

77
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:01,786
Watch it, jerk!

78
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,380
Oh, hey. Wow.

79
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:14,341
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

80
00:09:14,507 --> 00:09:16,092
Where were you headed, Parker?

81
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:17,552
To your class.

82
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:19,554
My class is over.

83
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:21,932
See me standing here?

84
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:25,894
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.

85
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:27,395
Then be here.

86
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:30,232
Look at you, Peter.

87
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:35,111
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

88
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,198
You always appear exhausted.

89
00:09:39,616 --> 00:09:41,701
Your paper on fusion
is still overdue.

90
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:44,996
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

91
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:48,333
Planning is not a major
at this university.

92
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,672
Octavius is a friend of mine.

93
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:56,007
Better do your research, Parker.

94
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:59,511
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

95
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:23,076
Surprise!

96
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:25,161
Well, say something.

97
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:26,621
Uh, what's the occasion?

98
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:29,332
- Really, Peter. It's your birthday!
- "What's the occasion"?

99
00:10:29,874 --> 00:10:31,543
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

100
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:36,339
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

101
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:38,466
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.

102
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:40,302
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

103
00:10:40,468 --> 00:10:41,720
Long time, no see.

104
00:10:42,637 --> 00:10:45,765
So, uh, how's the play?
I read a great review.

105
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:47,642
It's going fine.
It's going good.

106
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:49,060
She's brilliant in it.

107
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:50,895
Harry sent me roses.

108
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:53,648
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

109
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:56,985
I've been busy.

110
00:10:57,152 --> 00:11:00,697
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

111
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,824
The less you see of that man,
the better.

112
00:11:02,991 --> 00:11:06,494
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

113
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:07,996
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

114
00:11:08,163 --> 00:11:10,206
So how are things going at Oscorp?

115
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:13,251
Oh, they're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

116
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:15,545
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

117
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:19,924
Oh, how lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

118
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:21,426
Thank you.

119
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:25,513
We're actually funding one of
your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

120
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,183
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?

121
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,601
You'd introduce me?

122
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:32,979
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map

123
00:11:33,146 --> 00:11:35,231
in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

124
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:37,275
M.J., could you give
me a hand?

125
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:41,237
She's waiting for you, pal.

126
00:11:41,946 --> 00:11:43,198
What do you mean?

127
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:45,825
Oh, the way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

128
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:47,702
However you want to look at it.

129
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:50,246
I don't have time for girls
right now.

130
00:11:50,413 --> 00:11:51,748
Why, are you dead?

131
00:11:51,915 --> 00:11:53,416
I've been kind of busy.

132
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,293
Taking pictures of your friend?

133
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:58,296
Could we get off that subject?

134
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:01,800
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

135
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:03,593
Then be honest with me.

136
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:06,346
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

137
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:31,579
May.

138
00:12:31,746 --> 00:12:34,499
Oh, what, Ben? Hmm?

139
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,584
Wait. Oh...

140
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:38,253
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.

141
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,883
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

142
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:48,012
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

143
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,098
Did they have a good time?

144
00:12:50,598 --> 00:12:51,891
I'm sure they did.

145
00:12:53,726 --> 00:12:57,564
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.

146
00:12:58,148 --> 00:13:03,319
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

147
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:05,238
I'm worried about you.

148
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:10,577
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

149
00:13:10,785 --> 00:13:13,288
Oh, my. You did?

150
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:15,123
Oh, Well.

151
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,749
So?

152
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:18,960
I'm a little behind.

153
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:21,671
Everybody is.

154
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,341
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

155
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:29,262
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

156
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:33,516
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

157
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:35,518
You need it more than I do.

158
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:38,229
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!

159
00:13:38,396 --> 00:13:40,440
You can take this money from me.

160
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:43,318
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

161
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:45,987
And don't you dare
leave it here.

162
00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:47,405
Oh, I'm sorry.

163
00:13:49,324 --> 00:13:52,452
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.

164
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:59,834
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

165
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,380
I think to myself at times,

166
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:09,844
were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...

167
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:12,931
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

168
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:21,064
Now,

169
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:25,693
you better take
the rest of your cake home.

170
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,960
Hey.

171
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:44,295
Hey. You're still here.

172
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,048
I saw your billboard
on Bleecker.

173
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:50,510
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

174
00:14:50,677 --> 00:14:54,764
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

175
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:59,811
I liked seeing you
tonight, Peter.

176
00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:03,815
Oh, boy, yeah.

177
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,402
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

178
00:15:11,906 --> 00:15:13,575
Nothing.

179
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:19,747
Do you want to say something?

180
00:15:25,753 --> 00:15:27,380
I...

181
00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:34,596
was...

182
00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:38,850
wondering if you're still
in the Village.

183
00:15:47,984 --> 00:15:50,028
You're such a mystery.

184
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:02,081
Peter.

185
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,001
What?

186
00:16:09,964 --> 00:16:11,716
Happy birthday.

187
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:22,560
I'm seeing somebody now.

188
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:25,563
You mean, like a boyfriend?

189
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,399
Well, like I like him.

190
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,945
- Wow.
- What?

191
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,323
Nothing.

192
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:39,452
That's good, you know?
Companionship...

193
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:42,830
May be more than that.

194
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:45,500
More?

195
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:47,669
I don't know.

196
00:16:49,003 --> 00:16:51,214
I'm gonna come see your play
tomorrow night.

197
00:16:54,258 --> 00:16:57,220
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.

198
00:16:58,179 --> 00:16:59,889
Don't disappoint me.

199
00:17:01,349 --> 00:17:03,017
I won't.

200
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:18,700
Rent.

201
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:25,206
- Hi.
- Hi. What's "hi"?

202
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:27,375
- Can I spend it?
- Uh...

203
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,544
I have a paycheck due
this week and...

204
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:33,047
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as I...

205
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:36,718
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

206
00:17:37,343 --> 00:17:41,848
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. You know,
all I got is this 20 for the rest of the week.

207
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:44,058
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

208
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:49,063
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

209
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:52,608
Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.

210
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:54,652
Hi, Pete. OW! Oh!

211
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:42,074
Hello?

212
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:51,125
Rent?

213
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:58,633
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

214
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,678
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

215
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,639
It's not about the prizes,
Harry.

216
00:19:04,806 --> 00:19:06,599
Ah, but you need money.
You need Oscorp.

217
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:08,059
Who do we have here?

218
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:09,977
This is my good friend
I called you about.

219
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:11,984
The guy who got me through
high school science.

220
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:13,606
- Peter Parker, sir.
- Parker.

221
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:15,691
- I'm writing a paper on you for...
- Yes, yes.

222
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:19,418
I know what you're doing here, but I really
don't have time to talk to students right now.

223
00:19:20,738 --> 00:19:22,073
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...

224
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,468
That's right. That's why
I have to take off. Board meeting.

225
00:19:24,492 --> 00:19:27,829
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

226
00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:32,625
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

227
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:36,879
Interesting fellow, your friend.

228
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:39,274
- Well, I won't take much of your time.
- Parker.

229
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:43,678
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

230
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,556
He also tells me you're lazy.

231
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:48,808
I'm trying to do better.

232
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:52,562
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

233
00:19:52,895 --> 00:19:56,065
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

234
00:19:56,232 --> 00:19:58,359
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

235
00:19:58,526 --> 00:20:00,027
You want to try it back there?

236
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:02,405
So is that it?

237
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:06,993
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

238
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,288
I understand you use
harmonics of atomic frequencies.

239
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:11,831
Sympathetic frequencies.

240
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:14,041
Harmonic reinforcement?

241
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,085
Go on.

242
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:20,214
An exponential increase
in energy output.

243
00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:22,049
A huge amount of energy.

244
00:20:22,216 --> 00:20:26,387
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

245
00:20:26,554 --> 00:20:28,634
Are you sure you could stabilize
the fusion reaction?

246
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:33,269
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

247
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:35,771
This is my life's work.

248
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:39,275
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

249
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:41,736
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to question you.

250
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:45,239
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

251
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:47,241
You can sleep soundly tonight.

252
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:49,160
Otto's done his homework.

253
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:52,413
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

254
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:55,082
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

255
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:57,460
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

256
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,254
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

257
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:02,548
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the 5th?

258
00:21:02,715 --> 00:21:06,010
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

259
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,679
Ah, Rosie, I love this boy.

260
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:12,308
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

261
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:15,269
Uh, Well...

262
00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:17,772
I don't really know.

263
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:21,025
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

264
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:24,236
Well, leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

265
00:21:24,403 --> 00:21:26,280
Love should never be a secret.

266
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:29,742
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside,

267
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:32,119
gonna make you sick.

268
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:34,538
I finally got lucky in love.

269
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:36,040
We both did.

270
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:39,919
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

271
00:21:40,086 --> 00:21:43,798
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

272
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:47,218
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

273
00:21:47,385 --> 00:21:50,554
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

274
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:53,224
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

275
00:21:54,517 --> 00:21:56,495
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

276
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,396
- Oh, come on. Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.

277
00:21:58,562 --> 00:22:01,565
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

278
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:06,070
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

279
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:07,738
Poetry.

280
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:10,408
Never fails.

281
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:17,915
A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie.

282
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:20,459
Brightest green
Were all her garments.

283
00:22:20,626 --> 00:22:23,004
And her hair was like the sunshine.

284
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:24,922
Day by day he gazed upon her.

285
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:24,899
Rent!

286
00:23:26,817 --> 00:23:28,527
Where is my money?!

287
00:23:54,178 --> 00:23:56,472
- You seem jittery tonight.
- Oh.

288
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:58,432
You never know who's coming.

289
00:24:13,781 --> 00:24:16,742
Ladies, five minutes.
Five minutes.

290
00:24:33,926 --> 00:24:35,261
How'd you do that?

291
00:24:38,264 --> 00:24:40,558
Work out, plenty of rest.

292
00:24:40,808 --> 00:24:42,643
You know, eat your
green vegetables.

293
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,106
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

294
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,277
Come on. Go.

295
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:55,614
Keep it steady.

296
00:25:18,137 --> 00:25:19,638
It's a web.

297
00:25:20,681 --> 00:25:22,391
Go, Spidey, go!

298
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:31,734
We got trouble!

299
00:25:50,377 --> 00:25:52,338
Get me down!

300
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:55,883
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

301
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,345
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

302
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:01,639
Then you think we should
forgive them?

303
00:26:04,516 --> 00:26:06,185
Yes.

304
00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:08,187
I mean, no.

305
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:16,737
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

306
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:18,739
Whatever.

307
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:22,952
Shoelace.

308
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,083
You might want to...

309
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:38,634
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I, uh, come to see the show.

310
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:42,596
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

311
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:46,141
It helps maintain the illusion.

312
00:26:47,476 --> 00:26:50,938
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

313
00:26:51,105 --> 00:26:52,606
But not to come late.

314
00:26:55,025 --> 00:26:57,569
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the...

315
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:14,336
A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man.

316
00:27:14,503 --> 00:27:17,506
A-does whatever a spider can.

317
00:27:17,673 --> 00:27:20,676
A-spins a web, any size.

318
00:27:20,843 --> 00:27:23,220
Catches thieves a-just like flies.

319
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:26,640
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man.

320
00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:45,034
Hey. You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

321
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,577
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Yeah?

322
00:27:46,744 --> 00:27:48,662
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.

323
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:50,539
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.

324
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,627
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

325
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,255
What are you doing here?

326
00:28:13,354 --> 00:28:14,605
You hungry?

327
00:28:14,772 --> 00:28:16,106
Starved.

328
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:08,575
What was that?

329
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:14,790
Okay.

330
00:29:54,288 --> 00:29:55,914
Cool Spidey outfit.

331
00:29:57,749 --> 00:29:59,460
Thanks.

332
00:30:00,961 --> 00:30:02,296
Where'd you get it?

333
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:04,923
I made it.

334
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:10,471
Looks uncomfortable.

335
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:13,974
Yeah, it gets kind of itchy.

336
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:20,272
And it rides up in the
crotch a little bit too.

337
00:31:11,281 --> 00:31:13,575
- Hi. It's me.
- Sing your song at the beep.

338
00:31:15,244 --> 00:31:16,495
Hi, M.J.

339
00:31:16,662 --> 00:31:17,955
This is Peter.

340
00:31:18,497 --> 00:31:21,542
I was on my way
to your show and...

341
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:26,088
Well, I was on my bike...

342
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:30,842
Are you there?

343
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,348
I really was planning on it all clay.

344
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,184
And...

345
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:42,896
I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

346
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,898
Bingo.

347
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:47,568
It's amazing, isn't it?

348
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:51,363
How complicated a simple thing

349
00:31:52,573 --> 00:31:56,660
like being some place at 8:00
can become.

350
00:32:00,455 --> 00:32:04,418
Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.

351
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:08,213
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

352
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,923
Your time has expired.

353
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,303
Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.

354
00:32:24,021 --> 00:32:26,106
I wanna tell you the truth.

355
00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:29,693
Here it is.

356
00:32:30,736 --> 00:32:32,362
I'm Spider-Man.

357
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,906
Weird, huh?

358
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:39,077
Now you know
why I can't be with you.

359
00:32:40,203 --> 00:32:44,875
If my enemies found out
about you,

360
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:50,964
if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

361
00:32:56,803 --> 00:32:59,806
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

362
00:33:11,318 --> 00:33:12,611
Ladies and gentlemen,

363
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:16,615
my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

364
00:33:16,782 --> 00:33:18,450
But first, before we start,

365
00:33:18,617 --> 00:33:22,996
has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

366
00:33:23,413 --> 00:33:24,998
Because we found
the rubber band.

367
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:31,004
It's a terrible joke.

368
00:33:31,171 --> 00:33:32,923
But thank you for coming.

369
00:33:33,256 --> 00:33:34,508
Today,

370
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:39,179
you will witness the birth of a
new fusion-based energy source.

371
00:33:39,513 --> 00:33:44,685
Safe, renewable energy and
cheap electricity for everyone.

372
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:49,314
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

373
00:33:56,905 --> 00:33:59,908
These four actuators were
developed and programmed

374
00:34:00,075 --> 00:34:03,537
for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

375
00:34:03,704 --> 00:34:06,248
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

376
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:55,714
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

377
00:34:56,381 --> 00:34:59,176
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum,

378
00:34:59,342 --> 00:35:03,430
allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction

379
00:35:03,597 --> 00:35:06,349
in an environment
no human hand could enter.

380
00:35:06,516 --> 00:35:09,060
Doctor, if the artificial
intelligence in the arms

381
00:35:09,227 --> 00:35:10,937
is as advanced as you suggest,

382
00:35:11,104 --> 00:35:13,231
uh, couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

383
00:35:13,398 --> 00:35:14,649
How right you are.

384
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,985
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip

385
00:35:17,152 --> 00:35:19,446
to protect
my higher brain function.

386
00:35:19,613 --> 00:35:24,075
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

387
00:35:24,868 --> 00:35:26,703
And now on to the main event.

388
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,789
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

389
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:52,229
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

390
00:35:52,395 --> 00:35:55,524
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

391
00:35:56,149 --> 00:36:00,362
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp Industries for providing it.

392
00:36:00,612 --> 00:36:02,447
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

393
00:36:16,294 --> 00:36:17,796
Ladies and gentlemen,

394
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,175
fasten your seat belts.

395
00:36:40,986 --> 00:36:43,530
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

396
00:36:48,326 --> 00:36:51,663
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

397
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,081
Thank you.

398
00:36:53,248 --> 00:36:55,917
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

399
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:04,676
The power of the sun

400
00:37:05,302 --> 00:37:07,429
in the palm of my hand.

401
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:31,620
Keep calm!
It's only a spike!

402
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:33,622
It'll soon stabilize!

403
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,420
- Pete...
- Ladies and gentlemen,

404
00:37:40,587 --> 00:37:42,088
please clear the room.

405
00:37:47,928 --> 00:37:49,304
We have a containment breach!

406
00:37:51,973 --> 00:37:54,100
Otto, please get back!

407
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:57,938
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

408
00:37:58,271 --> 00:38:00,941
It will stabilize!
It's under control!

409
00:38:01,107 --> 00:38:02,943
I'm in charge here!

410
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:05,946
It's my money! I'm in con...

411
00:38:09,574 --> 00:38:11,618
This doesn't change anything.

412
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:17,290
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.

413
00:38:17,707 --> 00:38:18,959
No!

414
00:38:37,894 --> 00:38:39,562
Rosie!

415
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:11,344
Watch it.

416
00:39:11,511 --> 00:39:12,762
That was too close.

417
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:16,975
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

418
00:39:22,355 --> 00:39:23,773
I'm ruined.

419
00:39:25,442 --> 00:39:27,944
I have nothing left,
except Spider-Man.

420
00:39:28,111 --> 00:39:29,779
He saved your life, sir.

421
00:39:30,196 --> 00:39:32,615
He humiliated me by touching me.

422
00:39:32,782 --> 00:39:35,368
Mr. Osborn, the press will be here
soon. I suggest we move on.

423
00:39:35,535 --> 00:39:37,454
What was he doing here anyway?

424
00:39:53,887 --> 00:39:56,306
As you can see, molten metal
penetrated the spinal cavity

425
00:39:56,473 --> 00:39:58,600
and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points,

426
00:39:58,767 --> 00:40:01,352
including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

427
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:03,831
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

428
00:40:03,855 --> 00:40:07,067
So I suggest we cut off these
mechanical arms, slice up the harness

429
00:40:07,233 --> 00:40:09,360
and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy

430
00:40:09,527 --> 00:40:12,781
with posterior spinal fusion
from C7-T1 to T12.

431
00:40:13,073 --> 00:40:14,365
We're ready, doctor.

432
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,496
Anybody here take shop class?

433
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:04,582
Help me! Help me!

434
00:42:15,653 --> 00:42:19,157
No!

435
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:13,461
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumors.

436
00:43:13,628 --> 00:43:15,797
Panic in the streets,
if we're lucky.

437
00:43:15,964 --> 00:43:18,758
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

438
00:43:18,925 --> 00:43:21,928
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

439
00:43:22,428 --> 00:43:27,100
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

440
00:43:27,267 --> 00:43:28,851
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?

441
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,164
- What are we gonna call this guy?
- Uh... Uh...

442
00:43:32,188 --> 00:43:34,399
- "Dr. Octopus."
- That's crap.

443
00:43:34,565 --> 00:43:36,109
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!

444
00:43:36,734 --> 00:43:38,403
- "Doctor Strange."
- That's pretty good.

445
00:43:39,195 --> 00:43:43,074
But it's taken. Wait, wait!
I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

446
00:43:43,241 --> 00:43:45,868
- Um, but... I like it.
- Of course you do.

447
00:43:46,035 --> 00:43:49,789
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

448
00:43:49,956 --> 00:43:52,041
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?

449
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:53,793
Get out.

450
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,753
Chief, I found Parker.

451
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,565
Where you been? Looking for you all
morning. Why don't you pay your phone bill.

452
00:43:58,589 --> 00:44:00,734
Mad scientist goes berserk,
and we don't have pictures!

453
00:44:00,758 --> 00:44:02,844
I heard Spider-Man was there.

454
00:44:03,219 --> 00:44:05,805
Where were you? Photographing squirrels?
You're fired.

455
00:44:05,972 --> 00:44:07,390
Chief, the planetarium party.

456
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:09,368
Oh, right. You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

457
00:44:09,392 --> 00:44:10,977
What do you know
about high society?

458
00:44:11,144 --> 00:44:13,354
- Oh. Uh, well, I...
- Ah, don't answer that.

459
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:17,191
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

460
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:20,111
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

461
00:44:20,278 --> 00:44:22,030
Could you pay me in advance?

462
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,499
You serious? Pay you
for what? Standing there?

463
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:36,336
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.

464
00:44:51,434 --> 00:44:53,186
My Rosie's dead.

465
00:44:55,355 --> 00:44:57,106
My dream is dead.

466
00:45:00,818 --> 00:45:02,070
And these...

467
00:45:04,072 --> 00:45:07,575
monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river,

468
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:11,829
along with me.

469
00:45:20,755 --> 00:45:22,382
Something...

470
00:45:23,883 --> 00:45:25,885
in my head.

471
00:45:29,055 --> 00:45:30,598
Something talking.

472
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:36,104
The inhibitor chip!

473
00:45:39,524 --> 00:45:41,067
Gone.

474
00:45:45,863 --> 00:45:47,156
Rebuild.

475
00:45:50,576 --> 00:45:52,245
No.

476
00:45:53,413 --> 00:45:54,872
Peter was right.

477
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:58,793
I miscalculated.

478
00:46:05,383 --> 00:46:07,427
I couldn't have miscalculated.

479
00:46:08,553 --> 00:46:10,471
It was working, wasn't it?

480
00:46:15,393 --> 00:46:16,769
Yes.

481
00:46:17,854 --> 00:46:20,857
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

482
00:46:21,023 --> 00:46:23,276
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

483
00:46:24,152 --> 00:46:25,987
But we need money.

484
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,115
Steal it?

485
00:46:29,282 --> 00:46:31,117
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

486
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:35,037
That's right.

487
00:46:36,956 --> 00:46:40,168
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

488
00:46:43,796 --> 00:46:45,465
We'll do it here.

489
00:46:46,174 --> 00:46:49,469
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

490
00:46:49,802 --> 00:46:52,305
Nothing will stand in our way.

491
00:46:52,472 --> 00:46:53,806
Nothing!

492
00:46:59,228 --> 00:47:01,814
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.

493
00:47:02,148 --> 00:47:03,816
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

494
00:47:03,983 --> 00:47:06,235
Yes, but I'm afraid

495
00:47:06,402 --> 00:47:09,489
it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

496
00:47:09,822 --> 00:47:13,326
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.

497
00:47:13,493 --> 00:47:14,785
You are?

498
00:47:19,874 --> 00:47:23,169
We... We appreciate
that you've just opened up

499
00:47:23,336 --> 00:47:25,922
a new supersaver account
with us today.

500
00:47:26,088 --> 00:47:27,340
But the fact is,

501
00:47:27,507 --> 00:47:31,844
you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

502
00:47:32,512 --> 00:47:34,055
Well...

503
00:47:35,848 --> 00:47:37,683
At least we get the toaster.

504
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:41,854
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of, uh, 300 or more.

505
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,025
Oh, yes, I see.

506
00:47:47,527 --> 00:47:49,153
Okay.

507
00:47:52,198 --> 00:47:54,325
Don't worry,
we'll figure it out.

508
00:48:11,634 --> 00:48:12,969
Peter?

509
00:48:14,845 --> 00:48:16,847
Don't leave me.

510
00:48:17,682 --> 00:48:20,101
Oh, that boy of yours
is a real hero.

511
00:48:20,601 --> 00:48:21,852
Hold it!

512
00:48:22,603 --> 00:48:25,273
Put your arms up! All of them!

513
00:48:48,546 --> 00:48:49,880
Here's your change!

514
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:01,392
Oh, no. Come on!

515
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:16,979
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.

516
00:49:17,116 --> 00:49:18,743
Not anymore.

517
00:49:48,439 --> 00:49:50,274
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!

518
00:49:54,195 --> 00:49:56,030
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.

519
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,702
Wait a second.

520
00:50:19,428 --> 00:50:21,722
- Hand her over.
- Of course.

521
00:50:22,473 --> 00:50:23,724
Easy, now.

522
00:50:25,434 --> 00:50:27,144
Butterfingers.

523
00:50:39,407 --> 00:50:40,658
Look out!

524
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,829
Help me!

525
00:50:46,914 --> 00:50:49,500
- Help me!
- I'm coming!

526
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:56,674
Hang on!

527
00:51:14,442 --> 00:51:15,860
Help!

528
00:51:35,713 --> 00:51:37,381
Thank you.

529
00:51:40,593 --> 00:51:41,927
Aunt May.

530
00:51:42,094 --> 00:51:45,097
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

531
00:51:45,264 --> 00:51:48,309
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

532
00:51:53,773 --> 00:51:55,399
Come on.

533
00:51:59,403 --> 00:52:01,489
Shame on you.

534
00:52:18,506 --> 00:52:20,174
Woo-how.!

535
00:52:33,938 --> 00:52:35,564
There you go.

536
00:52:36,524 --> 00:52:39,860
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

537
00:52:40,027 --> 00:52:41,320
We sure showed him.

538
00:52:41,487 --> 00:52:43,239
What do you mean, "we"?

539
00:52:47,368 --> 00:52:49,745
- Take me with you, Spider-Man.
- No, take me.

540
00:53:17,189 --> 00:53:19,859
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.

541
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,736
Penny! Over here!

542
00:53:28,117 --> 00:53:29,660
Leave it.

543
00:53:33,706 --> 00:53:36,208
Hey. Might wanna
take it easy, buddy.

544
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:37,710
Why? It's a party.

545
00:53:37,877 --> 00:53:41,005
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot

546
00:53:41,171 --> 00:53:44,425
who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

547
00:53:44,717 --> 00:53:46,385
Not to mention your friend the bug.

548
00:53:46,927 --> 00:53:48,178
Not tonight, Harry.

549
00:53:48,345 --> 00:53:51,807
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24-7.

550
00:53:52,308 --> 00:53:53,767
Parker!

551
00:53:54,393 --> 00:53:55,644
Parker!

552
00:53:56,186 --> 00:53:58,939
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

553
00:53:59,106 --> 00:54:01,626
Come on, what do you think, I'm paying
you to sit around, sip champagne?

554
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,650
Here, get a shot of my wife
with the minister here.

555
00:54:03,944 --> 00:54:05,237
Beautiful tie.

556
00:54:05,404 --> 00:54:07,656
Ooh! No, get a shot of us
with the DA.

557
00:54:08,073 --> 00:54:09,575
Beautiful dress.

558
00:54:09,992 --> 00:54:12,411
Ooh! Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

559
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,664
Wife.

560
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:19,960
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

561
00:54:20,127 --> 00:54:23,172
The committee for
the Science Library of New York

562
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:25,591
is pleased to present
our guest of honor.

563
00:54:25,758 --> 00:54:28,886
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

564
00:54:30,596 --> 00:54:33,766
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious.

565
00:54:33,933 --> 00:54:35,809
Captain John Jameson.

566
00:55:20,479 --> 00:55:22,022
Hi.

567
00:55:23,315 --> 00:55:27,695
- Oh. You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.

568
00:55:27,861 --> 00:55:29,989
But there was a disturbance.

569
00:55:30,197 --> 00:55:31,532
I don't know you.

570
00:55:33,534 --> 00:55:37,454
And I can't keep thinking
about you. It's too painful.

571
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:40,040
I've been reading poetry lately.

572
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:41,583
Whatever that means.

573
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:45,587
Day by day he gazed upon her.

574
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:48,841
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day...

575
00:55:49,008 --> 00:55:50,884
Don't start.

576
00:55:52,344 --> 00:55:54,013
Can I get you a drink?

577
00:55:54,221 --> 00:55:56,056
I'm with John.
He'll get me my drink.

578
00:55:56,724 --> 00:55:58,350
John.

579
00:55:58,517 --> 00:56:02,396
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

580
00:56:02,563 --> 00:56:05,566
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

581
00:56:05,733 --> 00:56:08,068
My sick mother got out of bed
to see it.

582
00:56:08,235 --> 00:56:09,611
Even my father.

583
00:56:10,863 --> 00:56:13,574
He came backstage
to borrow cash.

584
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,580
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me,

585
00:56:19,747 --> 00:56:21,915
can't make an 8:00 curtain.

586
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:25,169
After all these years,

587
00:56:26,462 --> 00:56:29,089
he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.

588
00:56:54,573 --> 00:56:58,077
You know, it pisses me off, your loyalty
to Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

589
00:56:58,243 --> 00:57:01,514
I find him with my father's body, and you
defend him because he's your bread and butter.

590
00:57:01,538 --> 00:57:03,540
- Hey, take it easy.
- Hey, don't push me.

591
00:57:03,707 --> 00:57:05,584
Don't act like you're my friend.

592
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:08,295
You stole M.J. from me.

593
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:10,631
You stole my father's love.

594
00:57:11,298 --> 00:57:16,303
Then you let him die because you didn't
turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

595
00:57:17,513 --> 00:57:19,765
Huh? Isn't that right?

596
00:57:19,932 --> 00:57:21,725
Huh, brother?

597
00:57:32,694 --> 00:57:35,447
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know

598
00:57:36,156 --> 00:57:40,202
that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.

599
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:52,589
What a surprise.

600
00:57:52,756 --> 00:57:55,676
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

601
00:58:22,744 --> 00:58:25,038
Oh, no. No!

602
00:58:36,091 --> 00:58:38,260
Why is this happening to me?

603
01:00:05,597 --> 01:00:07,557
You seem very okay to me.

604
01:00:08,267 --> 01:00:09,643
My diagnosis?

605
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:11,603
It's up here.

606
01:00:14,314 --> 01:00:18,318
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

607
01:00:19,486 --> 01:00:22,239
There is one dream where,

608
01:00:22,656 --> 01:00:24,157
in my dream,

609
01:00:25,325 --> 01:00:26,660
I'm Spider-Man.

610
01:00:27,077 --> 01:00:31,498
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

611
01:00:35,252 --> 01:00:36,837
So you're Spider-Man.

612
01:00:37,004 --> 01:00:38,255
In my dream.

613
01:00:38,422 --> 01:00:42,801
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

614
01:00:45,095 --> 01:00:46,680
Somebody else's dream.

615
01:00:52,477 --> 01:00:54,354
What about this friend?

616
01:00:54,521 --> 01:00:57,858
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

617
01:00:58,358 --> 01:01:02,321
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

618
01:01:02,946 --> 01:01:06,700
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

619
01:01:06,867 --> 01:01:08,660
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

620
01:01:09,453 --> 01:01:11,038
Listen,

621
01:01:11,913 --> 01:01:16,168
maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

622
01:01:16,585 --> 01:01:18,337
That's why you keep falling.

623
01:01:20,797 --> 01:01:22,716
You always have a choice, Peter.

624
01:01:24,968 --> 01:01:26,678
I have a choice.

625
01:01:35,771 --> 01:01:38,774
All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter,

626
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,318
make me sad.

627
01:01:42,819 --> 01:01:44,738
Can't you understand?

628
01:01:45,489 --> 01:01:47,783
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

629
01:01:48,575 --> 01:01:51,661
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty,

630
01:01:52,245 --> 01:01:54,915
fairness, justice...

631
01:01:55,665 --> 01:02:00,420
Out of those times, I counted on you
to have the courage

632
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:04,508
to take those dreams
out into the world.

633
01:02:05,592 --> 01:02:08,178
I can't live your dreams anymore.

634
01:02:09,346 --> 01:02:11,181
I want a life of my own.

635
01:02:11,348 --> 01:02:13,475
You've been given a gift, Peter.

636
01:02:13,767 --> 01:02:18,021
With great power
comes great responsibility.

637
01:02:22,609 --> 01:02:24,277
Take my hand, son.

638
01:02:37,541 --> 01:02:39,209
No, Uncle Ben.

639
01:02:41,294 --> 01:02:43,547
I'm just Peter Parker.

640
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:47,050
I'm Spider-Man

641
01:02:47,926 --> 01:02:49,469
no more.

642
01:02:50,637 --> 01:02:52,013
No more.

643
01:03:00,272 --> 01:03:01,731
No more.

644
01:04:29,069 --> 01:04:30,403
Hey!

645
01:04:30,862 --> 01:04:33,031
- You punk!
- Sorry.

646
01:04:33,698 --> 01:04:35,575
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

647
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:44,376
Hurry up!

648
01:04:53,927 --> 01:04:57,639
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?

649
01:04:57,806 --> 01:04:59,641
Someone, please?

650
01:05:01,768 --> 01:05:04,020
.23 electron volts.

651
01:05:09,276 --> 01:05:12,153
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

652
01:05:22,706 --> 01:05:25,768
Why, I'm not really wicked at all, Cousin
Cecily. You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

653
01:05:25,792 --> 01:05:28,837
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all

654
01:05:29,004 --> 01:05:30,755
in a very inexcusable manner.

655
01:05:30,922 --> 01:05:33,258
I hope you have not been
leading a double life,

656
01:05:33,425 --> 01:05:36,469
pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

657
01:05:36,636 --> 01:05:38,388
That would be hypocrisy.

658
01:05:38,597 --> 01:05:40,682
Oh. Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

659
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:44,394
Hi.

660
01:05:47,647 --> 01:05:49,149
"I am glad."

661
01:05:49,983 --> 01:05:51,985
"I am glad."

662
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:54,070
"I am glad."

663
01:05:55,905 --> 01:05:58,033
Are you glad to hear it?

664
01:06:00,243 --> 01:06:02,579
I am glad

665
01:06:02,746 --> 01:06:04,205
to hear it.

666
01:06:04,372 --> 01:06:06,124
In fact, now you mention
the subject,

667
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:09,878
I have been very bad
in my own small way.

668
01:06:10,837 --> 01:06:14,799
Oh. You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

669
01:06:14,966 --> 01:06:17,010
You could've told me
you were coming.

670
01:06:17,177 --> 01:06:19,512
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

671
01:06:23,224 --> 01:06:24,893
You look different.

672
01:06:25,644 --> 01:06:30,565
I shined my shoes, pressed
my pants, did my homework.

673
01:06:30,732 --> 01:06:32,651
I do my homework now.

674
01:06:34,736 --> 01:06:36,571
You wanna get some chow mein?

675
01:06:36,738 --> 01:06:38,156
Peter,

676
01:06:38,573 --> 01:06:40,158
I'm getting married.

677
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,999
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

678
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:49,959
And who's the groom?

679
01:06:50,293 --> 01:06:52,003
You hadn't decided yet.

680
01:06:54,422 --> 01:06:56,549
You think just because
you saw my play,

681
01:06:56,716 --> 01:06:59,094
you can talk me out
of getting married?

682
01:06:59,386 --> 01:07:02,555
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

683
01:07:02,722 --> 01:07:06,226
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

684
01:07:06,726 --> 01:07:08,269
You're too late.

685
01:07:09,396 --> 01:07:10,730
Will you think about it?

686
01:07:10,897 --> 01:07:12,232
Think about what?

687
01:07:12,399 --> 01:07:14,401
Picking up where we left off.

688
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:15,860
Where was that?

689
01:07:16,027 --> 01:07:18,655
We never got on. You can't get off
if you don't get on, Peter.

690
01:07:18,822 --> 01:07:20,156
I don't think it's that simple.

691
01:07:20,323 --> 01:07:22,575
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

692
01:07:22,742 --> 01:07:24,411
You don't understand.

693
01:07:24,911 --> 01:07:27,330
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

694
01:07:27,914 --> 01:07:29,290
I'm different.

695
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:31,918
Punch me, I bleed.

696
01:07:39,175 --> 01:07:40,677
I have to go.

697
01:07:47,767 --> 01:07:49,978
I'm getting married in a church.

698
01:07:57,694 --> 01:07:59,237
You are different.

699
01:08:14,127 --> 01:08:17,255
Dear, we agreed to put on
a wedding, not go into bankruptcy.

700
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:20,633
Caviar? What, are we
inviting the tsar?

701
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,845
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail Weenies.

702
01:08:24,012 --> 01:08:27,182
Boss, I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.

703
01:08:27,348 --> 01:08:31,909
Don't tell me you have the head of an extraterrestrial in
there, because if you do, you're the third guy this week.

704
01:08:33,605 --> 01:08:35,440
Where the hell did you get that?

705
01:08:35,607 --> 01:08:37,150
In the garbage.

706
01:08:37,317 --> 01:08:38,735
In the garbage?

707
01:08:40,737 --> 01:08:42,489
He must've given up.

708
01:08:42,822 --> 01:08:47,535
Thrown in the towel. Abandoned
his sad little masquerade.

709
01:08:48,369 --> 01:08:51,623
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

710
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:56,586
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, uh, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

711
01:08:56,753 --> 01:08:59,839
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.

712
01:09:00,006 --> 01:09:03,635
All right, 100. Miss Brant, give this man
his money and throw in a bar of soap.

713
01:09:03,802 --> 01:09:05,762
Your wife is still on that line.

714
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:08,932
Flowers? How much?

715
01:09:09,557 --> 01:09:12,769
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

716
01:09:12,936 --> 01:09:14,187
Get plastic.

717
01:09:15,313 --> 01:09:16,940
Gotta go, big story.

718
01:09:28,034 --> 01:09:31,287
Spider-Man
Spider-Man.

719
01:09:31,454 --> 01:09:34,457
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

720
01:09:34,624 --> 01:09:38,044
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

721
01:09:45,468 --> 01:09:47,804
Come on, man. Get the money.

722
01:09:49,472 --> 01:09:51,307
Come on, come on.

723
01:09:53,685 --> 01:09:55,186
Help!

724
01:09:59,107 --> 01:10:00,358
Come on!

725
01:10:06,364 --> 01:10:09,075
It wasn't fair
to have gone like that.

726
01:10:09,242 --> 01:10:11,411
He was a peaceful man.

727
01:10:13,454 --> 01:10:15,707
And it was all my doing.

728
01:10:48,531 --> 01:10:51,951
Aunt May. You don't have to
punish yourself.

729
01:10:52,118 --> 01:10:54,162
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

730
01:10:54,537 --> 01:10:57,749
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway,

731
01:10:57,916 --> 01:11:00,084
and he wanted to drive you.

732
01:11:00,418 --> 01:11:02,962
If only I had stopped him.

733
01:11:03,421 --> 01:11:06,591
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

734
01:11:22,315 --> 01:11:23,858
I'm responsible.

735
01:11:27,779 --> 01:11:29,113
For what?

736
01:11:30,031 --> 01:11:32,241
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

737
01:11:32,408 --> 01:11:34,702
But you were at the library.

738
01:11:34,869 --> 01:11:36,829
You were doing your homework.

739
01:11:36,996 --> 01:11:40,124
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

740
01:11:40,959 --> 01:11:42,585
What do you mean?

741
01:11:43,336 --> 01:11:45,004
I went some place else.

742
01:11:45,171 --> 01:11:48,174
Some place where I thought
I could win some money

743
01:11:49,342 --> 01:11:52,095
to buy a car, because I wanted

744
01:11:53,137 --> 01:11:55,264
to impress Mary Jane.

745
01:11:57,392 --> 01:11:59,435
It happened so fast.

746
01:12:00,561 --> 01:12:04,440
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

747
01:12:05,942 --> 01:12:07,360
The thief

748
01:12:08,361 --> 01:12:10,363
was running towards me.

749
01:12:11,948 --> 01:12:14,742
I could've stopped him,
but I wanted

750
01:12:15,493 --> 01:12:17,036
revenge.

751
01:12:19,038 --> 01:12:20,540
I let him go.

752
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:25,378
I let him get away.

753
01:12:31,217 --> 01:12:33,052
He wanted a car.

754
01:12:33,219 --> 01:12:35,471
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

755
01:12:36,723 --> 01:12:39,976
Uncle Ben said no,

756
01:12:41,477 --> 01:12:43,646
and then he shot him.

757
01:12:47,233 --> 01:12:50,903
Uncle Ben was killed that night

758
01:12:52,572 --> 01:12:55,616
for being the only one
who did the right thing.

759
01:12:58,828 --> 01:13:00,079
And I, uh...

760
01:13:03,541 --> 01:13:05,585
I held his hand

761
01:13:06,169 --> 01:13:07,754
when he died.

762
01:13:15,386 --> 01:13:18,306
I've tried to tell you
so many times.

763
01:14:14,821 --> 01:14:17,115
Just one more little chore.

764
01:14:24,705 --> 01:14:26,124
Where are you?

765
01:14:28,334 --> 01:14:32,171
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.

766
01:14:32,338 --> 01:14:35,049
Your father only obsessed
over his work.

767
01:14:35,216 --> 01:14:36,843
Good night, Bernard.

768
01:15:30,229 --> 01:15:31,480
Hello, Harry.

769
01:15:31,647 --> 01:15:33,858
Otto. What do you want?

770
01:15:34,442 --> 01:15:36,027
That precious tritium.

771
01:15:36,903 --> 01:15:38,571
But I need more of it this time.

772
01:15:40,323 --> 01:15:44,327
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

773
01:15:48,247 --> 01:15:50,208
Hey! Hey!

774
01:15:50,374 --> 01:15:53,419
Stop! Stop! All right!

775
01:15:53,878 --> 01:15:57,590
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

776
01:16:07,516 --> 01:16:10,770
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

777
01:16:11,604 --> 01:16:15,483
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.

778
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:16,943
How do I find him?

779
01:16:18,194 --> 01:16:19,862
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?

780
01:16:20,029 --> 01:16:22,365
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the Bugle.

781
01:16:22,531 --> 01:16:24,033
Make him tell you where he is.

782
01:16:29,789 --> 01:16:31,123
Have it ready.

783
01:16:34,919 --> 01:16:36,462
Don't hurt Peter!

784
01:16:49,684 --> 01:16:52,144
Somebody, help!

785
01:16:53,062 --> 01:16:54,647
Fire!

786
01:17:02,822 --> 01:17:05,825
Alisa. Alisa, the Chens can't find
their daughter. Have you seen her?

787
01:17:07,243 --> 01:17:09,829
Somebody call the
fire department! Help!

788
01:17:10,621 --> 01:17:12,915
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?

789
01:17:13,082 --> 01:17:15,668
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

790
01:17:15,918 --> 01:17:17,586
Hey, where you going?!

791
01:17:38,774 --> 01:17:40,192
I'm coming!

792
01:18:04,717 --> 01:18:07,720
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

793
01:18:07,887 --> 01:18:10,181
Come on. Come on.

794
01:19:10,449 --> 01:19:12,410
Mama.

795
01:19:24,422 --> 01:19:25,965
You got some guts, kid.

796
01:19:26,132 --> 01:19:30,761
Some poor soul got trapped on
the fourth floor. Never made it out.

797
01:19:31,011 --> 01:19:32,471
Oh, man.

798
01:19:35,391 --> 01:19:38,978
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

799
01:19:39,145 --> 01:19:42,898
Let's pick it up! Let's get all
this equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

800
01:19:48,612 --> 01:19:51,615
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?

801
01:19:52,616 --> 01:19:54,076
What I need?

802
01:19:56,412 --> 01:19:58,831
What am I supposed to do?

803
01:20:05,504 --> 01:20:07,047
I shouldn't have without

804
01:20:07,673 --> 01:20:08,966
knocking.

805
01:20:13,512 --> 01:20:15,139
Come in.

806
01:20:18,184 --> 01:20:20,686
- Hi.
- Hi.

807
01:20:24,356 --> 01:20:26,984
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

808
01:20:28,986 --> 01:20:30,237
Okay.

809
01:20:31,864 --> 01:20:33,574
And a glass of milk?

810
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:38,245
That would be nice.

811
01:20:40,206 --> 01:20:42,333
Okay.

812
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,355
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

813
01:21:09,109 --> 01:21:10,694
You got a message.

814
01:21:11,862 --> 01:21:13,322
It's your aunt.

815
01:21:13,489 --> 01:21:15,241
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

816
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:32,675
What's going on?

817
01:21:32,841 --> 01:21:36,637
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

818
01:21:36,804 --> 01:21:40,474
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

819
01:21:40,724 --> 01:21:42,101
Why didn't you tell me?

820
01:21:42,268 --> 01:21:45,604
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

821
01:21:45,771 --> 01:21:49,149
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand,

822
01:21:49,316 --> 01:21:50,818
and I'm giving him $5.

823
01:21:50,985 --> 01:21:53,112
- That's Henry Jackson?
- Yes.

824
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:55,364
Yes. It's funny what
happens in two years.

825
01:21:55,656 --> 01:21:59,118
Nine years old,
has great ambitions.

826
01:21:59,868 --> 01:22:03,956
Um... Listen, about my last visit...

827
01:22:04,248 --> 01:22:06,584
Pish-posh, we needn't
talk about it.

828
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:11,297
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

829
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,303
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

830
01:22:18,971 --> 01:22:20,681
And I'm proud of you.

831
01:22:21,765 --> 01:22:24,143
And I thank you, and I...

832
01:22:25,436 --> 01:22:27,771
I love you, Peter.

833
01:22:28,981 --> 01:22:31,525
So very, very much.

834
01:22:51,003 --> 01:22:54,006
Hey. Where are all
my comic books?

835
01:22:54,173 --> 01:22:57,092
Oh, those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

836
01:23:00,012 --> 01:23:01,722
I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.

837
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:03,349
Thank you, Henry.

838
01:23:03,515 --> 01:23:05,059
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.

839
01:23:05,309 --> 01:23:06,602
You're getting tall.

840
01:23:06,769 --> 01:23:10,856
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.

841
01:23:11,023 --> 01:23:14,151
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?

842
01:23:15,027 --> 01:23:16,362
I used to.

843
01:23:16,528 --> 01:23:17,780
Where is he?

844
01:23:17,946 --> 01:23:22,242
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

845
01:23:24,161 --> 01:23:26,955
He, uh...

846
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:30,292
- quit.
- Why?

847
01:23:31,168 --> 01:23:33,045
Wanted to try other things.

848
01:23:33,212 --> 01:23:34,797
He'll be back, right?

849
01:23:36,131 --> 01:23:37,383
I don't know.

850
01:23:38,842 --> 01:23:41,845
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.

851
01:23:42,221 --> 01:23:44,014
Spider-Man.

852
01:23:44,181 --> 01:23:46,141
- Why?
- Well, he knows a hero

853
01:23:46,308 --> 01:23:48,060
when he sees one.

854
01:23:48,227 --> 01:23:51,980
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that,

855
01:23:52,147 --> 01:23:54,191
saving old girls like me.

856
01:23:54,358 --> 01:23:56,652
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

857
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,198
Courageous, self-sacrificing people

858
01:24:01,365 --> 01:24:03,701
setting examples for all of us.

859
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:06,495
Everybody loves a hero.

860
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:10,290
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

861
01:24:10,457 --> 01:24:14,628
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours

862
01:24:14,795 --> 01:24:16,630
just to get a glimpse of the one

863
01:24:16,797 --> 01:24:20,134
who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

864
01:24:21,468 --> 01:24:24,722
I believe there's a hero
in all of us

865
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:27,307
that keeps us honest,

866
01:24:27,975 --> 01:24:29,560
gives us strength,

867
01:24:29,977 --> 01:24:31,854
makes us noble

868
01:24:32,938 --> 01:24:36,483
and finally allows us to die
with pride.

869
01:24:37,651 --> 01:24:41,780
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady

870
01:24:41,947 --> 01:24:44,742
and give up the thing
we want the most.

871
01:24:46,493 --> 01:24:48,412
Even our dreams.

872
01:24:50,289 --> 01:24:53,041
Spider-Man did that for Henry,

873
01:24:53,208 --> 01:24:55,627
and he wonders where he's gone.

874
01:24:56,795 --> 01:24:58,630
He needs him.

875
01:25:03,093 --> 01:25:07,806
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

876
01:25:08,265 --> 01:25:10,476
But don't strain yourself.

877
01:25:10,642 --> 01:25:12,269
Okay.

878
01:25:30,996 --> 01:25:33,207
Strong focus on what I want.

879
01:26:00,484 --> 01:26:02,194
Woo-hoo!

880
01:26:03,237 --> 01:26:04,822
I'm back!

881
01:26:04,988 --> 01:26:06,365
I'm back!

882
01:26:23,966 --> 01:26:25,384
My back.

883
01:26:26,301 --> 01:26:27,678
My back.

884
01:26:51,827 --> 01:26:56,164
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

885
01:26:56,707 --> 01:26:57,958
Peter Parker?

886
01:26:58,709 --> 01:27:01,378
Oh. Positive.

887
01:27:01,587 --> 01:27:02,838
Thought he was your pal.

888
01:27:03,171 --> 01:27:05,424
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.

889
01:27:05,591 --> 01:27:09,011
Uh, he's just a great big jerk.

890
01:27:09,261 --> 01:27:11,138
The world's full of great big jerks.

891
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:14,433
You're adorable.

892
01:27:14,808 --> 01:27:16,435
It's just the uniform.

893
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:21,815
Lean your head back for me.

894
01:27:22,107 --> 01:27:24,568
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.

895
01:27:26,612 --> 01:27:28,280
- Just put my head back?
- Mm-hmm.

896
01:27:28,989 --> 01:27:30,616
Okay.

897
01:27:49,676 --> 01:27:51,178
Wow.

898
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:53,722
I'm back on the moon.

899
01:27:58,352 --> 01:27:59,853
You up there with me?

900
01:28:20,666 --> 01:28:22,834
- Hiya.
- Surprised?

901
01:28:23,001 --> 01:28:24,503
Very.

902
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:26,213
Thanks for coming.

903
01:28:26,546 --> 01:28:28,507
Everything okay?

904
01:28:28,966 --> 01:28:31,218
Uh, you might say so.

905
01:28:32,552 --> 01:28:36,348
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

906
01:28:38,767 --> 01:28:41,353
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

907
01:28:41,853 --> 01:28:45,732
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.

908
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:51,029
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night,

909
01:28:51,196 --> 01:28:54,700
that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.

910
01:28:55,617 --> 01:28:57,619
I was afraid to trust you.

911
01:28:59,287 --> 01:29:02,332
But I've been thinking
about it...

912
01:29:02,499 --> 01:29:06,169
Listen, there's more
for me to say.

913
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:14,052
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought...

914
01:29:14,219 --> 01:29:16,847
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

915
01:29:17,556 --> 01:29:19,349
I'm saying...

916
01:29:20,183 --> 01:29:21,852
I...

917
01:29:25,522 --> 01:29:28,525
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane,

918
01:29:29,067 --> 01:29:30,527
but I can't.

919
01:29:33,947 --> 01:29:37,200
My mind was playing tricks too.

920
01:29:41,913 --> 01:29:44,499
Do you love me, or not?

921
01:29:51,548 --> 01:29:53,175
I...

922
01:29:56,428 --> 01:29:57,763
don't.

923
01:30:02,559 --> 01:30:04,478
You don't.

924
01:30:14,029 --> 01:30:15,280
Kiss me.

925
01:30:17,449 --> 01:30:18,950
Kiss you?

926
01:30:19,117 --> 01:30:20,952
I need to know something.

927
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:25,165
Just one kiss.

928
01:31:12,462 --> 01:31:14,464
What's happening?

929
01:31:24,683 --> 01:31:26,351
Peter Parker,

930
01:31:27,185 --> 01:31:28,854
and the girlfriend.

931
01:31:29,312 --> 01:31:31,148
What do you want?

932
01:31:33,942 --> 01:31:36,194
I want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.

933
01:31:36,361 --> 01:31:38,989
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

934
01:31:39,156 --> 01:31:41,324
Well, I don't know where he is.

935
01:31:42,868 --> 01:31:44,369
Find him.

936
01:31:46,663 --> 01:31:49,499
Or I'll peel the flesh
off her bones.

937
01:31:49,666 --> 01:31:51,710
If you lay one finger on her...

938
01:31:51,877 --> 01:31:53,211
You'll do what?

939
01:33:06,952 --> 01:33:10,664
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiancée.

940
01:33:10,830 --> 01:33:12,457
Sorry, Jonah.

941
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,001
It's all my fault.

942
01:33:16,795 --> 01:33:19,130
I drove Spider-Man away.

943
01:33:19,381 --> 01:33:22,092
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.

944
01:33:24,052 --> 01:33:25,387
Yes.

945
01:33:26,846 --> 01:33:30,183
Spider-Man was a hero.

946
01:33:31,393 --> 01:33:33,186
I just couldn't see it.

947
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:36,398
He was a...

948
01:33:36,564 --> 01:33:39,234
A thief! A criminal!

949
01:33:39,776 --> 01:33:43,238
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

950
01:33:43,405 --> 01:33:46,324
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

951
01:33:46,491 --> 01:33:48,576
I want him strung up by his web!

952
01:33:50,078 --> 01:33:52,747
I want Spider-Man!

953
01:34:21,192 --> 01:34:22,569
Where is she?

954
01:34:22,736 --> 01:34:25,363
Oh, she'll be just fine.
Let's talk.

955
01:35:16,581 --> 01:35:17,832
What the hell?

956
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:24,876
You have a train to catch.

957
01:37:27,378 --> 01:37:29,214
Help!

958
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:33,718
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

959
01:37:52,529 --> 01:37:55,073
- It's Spider-Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!

960
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:56,741
Tell everyone to hang on!

961
01:37:56,908 --> 01:37:58,660
Brace yourselves!

962
01:38:19,847 --> 01:38:22,350
Any more bright ideas?

963
01:38:22,559 --> 01:38:24,894
I got a few, yeah!

964
01:38:46,249 --> 01:38:48,042
Whoa, watch out!

965
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,949
We're slowing down.

966
01:40:24,347 --> 01:40:26,307
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

967
01:40:27,308 --> 01:40:28,810
Slower. Gently.

968
01:40:34,065 --> 01:40:35,400
Is he alive?

969
01:40:39,153 --> 01:40:40,405
He's

970
01:40:40,571 --> 01:40:42,156
just a kid.

971
01:40:43,324 --> 01:40:45,159
No older than my son.

972
01:41:04,512 --> 01:41:06,305
It's all right.

973
01:41:10,727 --> 01:41:12,562
We found something.

974
01:41:21,946 --> 01:41:23,990
We won't tell nobody.

975
01:41:37,628 --> 01:41:40,173
It's good to have you back,
Spider-Man.

976
01:42:00,151 --> 01:42:01,986
He's mine!

977
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:05,531
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

978
01:42:05,865 --> 01:42:07,200
And me.

979
01:42:07,825 --> 01:42:09,160
Me too.

980
01:42:14,123 --> 01:42:15,666
Very well.

981
01:42:44,695 --> 01:42:46,656
Where do you want him?

982
01:42:54,455 --> 01:42:55,957
And the tritium?

983
01:43:10,471 --> 01:43:11,931
Yes.

984
01:43:41,961 --> 01:43:45,047
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

985
01:43:47,758 --> 01:43:50,303
First we'll see
who's behind the mask.

986
01:43:50,469 --> 01:43:52,930
I can look into your eyes
as you die.

987
01:43:55,683 --> 01:43:57,226
Pete.

988
01:43:57,602 --> 01:43:59,270
No.

989
01:43:59,896 --> 01:44:01,272
It can't be.

990
01:44:07,862 --> 01:44:09,196
Harry.

991
01:44:10,698 --> 01:44:14,118
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

992
01:44:15,453 --> 01:44:19,457
- He's got M.J.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.

993
01:44:20,207 --> 01:44:21,542
Tritium?

994
01:44:23,461 --> 01:44:25,463
He's making the machine again.

995
01:44:26,297 --> 01:44:30,551
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

996
01:44:30,718 --> 01:44:33,471
- Now, where is he?
- Peter,

997
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:36,474
you killed my father.

998
01:44:41,646 --> 01:44:45,775
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

999
01:44:46,484 --> 01:44:49,111
Harry, please,
I've got to stop him.

1000
01:44:59,872 --> 01:45:01,582
Hey!

1001
01:45:02,667 --> 01:45:04,335
Hey!

1002
01:45:05,711 --> 01:45:07,505
I'm talking to you!

1003
01:45:07,838 --> 01:45:11,342
You got what you needed for your
little science project, now let me go.

1004
01:45:11,509 --> 01:45:13,511
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

1005
01:45:13,678 --> 01:45:16,889
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

1006
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,516
He's not dead.

1007
01:45:18,766 --> 01:45:21,394
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.

1008
01:45:39,161 --> 01:45:40,496
Surprise.

1009
01:45:44,917 --> 01:45:46,544
As soon as you get free...

1010
01:45:48,713 --> 01:45:52,591
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

1011
01:45:52,758 --> 01:45:56,012
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.

1012
01:45:56,178 --> 01:45:58,472
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.

1013
01:45:59,598 --> 01:46:01,475
Well, I'm not.

1014
01:46:34,008 --> 01:46:35,259
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1015
01:46:51,192 --> 01:46:52,568
Run!

1016
01:47:16,967 --> 01:47:19,303
Let's see you scurry
out of this.

1017
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:45,412
Now what?

1018
01:48:15,526 --> 01:48:17,653
Dr. Octavius.

1019
01:48:20,865 --> 01:48:22,116
We have to shut it down.

1020
01:48:22,908 --> 01:48:24,493
Please tell me how.

1021
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:26,078
Peter Parker?

1022
01:48:29,665 --> 01:48:31,709
"Brilliant but lazy."

1023
01:48:32,042 --> 01:48:33,419
Look at what's happening.

1024
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:36,297
We must destroy it.

1025
01:48:41,927 --> 01:48:43,554
I can't destroy it.

1026
01:48:48,809 --> 01:48:50,144
I won't.

1027
01:48:55,733 --> 01:48:57,902
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.

1028
01:48:59,778 --> 01:49:03,490
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1029
01:49:05,201 --> 01:49:06,577
A privilege.

1030
01:49:07,244 --> 01:49:10,331
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1031
01:49:11,373 --> 01:49:13,250
Don't listen to them.

1032
01:49:19,089 --> 01:49:20,674
It was my dream.

1033
01:49:20,841 --> 01:49:25,346
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady

1034
01:49:25,512 --> 01:49:28,057
and give up the thing
we want the most.

1035
01:49:28,849 --> 01:49:30,517
Even our dreams.

1036
01:49:36,523 --> 01:49:38,359
You're right.

1037
01:49:45,574 --> 01:49:47,076
He's right.

1038
01:49:49,161 --> 01:49:50,788
Listen.

1039
01:49:52,957 --> 01:49:55,251
Listen to me now.

1040
01:49:58,128 --> 01:50:00,464
Listen to me now.

1041
01:50:04,176 --> 01:50:07,137
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1042
01:50:08,264 --> 01:50:09,932
It can't be stopped.

1043
01:50:11,308 --> 01:50:13,352
It's self-sustaining now.

1044
01:50:13,602 --> 01:50:15,646
- Think!
- Unless...

1045
01:50:17,439 --> 01:50:18,983
The river.

1046
01:50:20,317 --> 01:50:21,944
Drown it.

1047
01:50:23,696 --> 01:50:25,239
I'll do it.

1048
01:51:10,617 --> 01:51:13,287
No!

1049
01:51:25,299 --> 01:51:26,884
Hi.

1050
01:51:27,551 --> 01:51:29,219
Hi.

1051
01:51:30,012 --> 01:51:31,472
This is really heavy.

1052
01:51:56,038 --> 01:51:57,998
M.J.

1053
01:51:58,791 --> 01:52:00,626
In case we die...

1054
01:52:00,793 --> 01:52:02,378
You do love me.

1055
01:52:02,961 --> 01:52:04,213
I do.

1056
01:52:05,172 --> 01:52:07,257
Even though you said you didn't.

1057
01:52:10,177 --> 01:52:12,638
I will not die a monster.

1058
01:53:17,870 --> 01:53:19,955
I think I always knew,

1059
01:53:20,998 --> 01:53:22,666
all this time,

1060
01:53:23,834 --> 01:53:25,627
who you really were.

1061
01:53:26,211 --> 01:53:28,797
Then you know
why we can't be together.

1062
01:53:30,007 --> 01:53:32,843
Spider-Man will always
have enemies.

1063
01:53:34,803 --> 01:53:37,514
I can't let you take that risk.

1064
01:53:42,186 --> 01:53:43,562
I will...

1065
01:53:45,230 --> 01:53:47,524
always be Spider-Man.

1066
01:53:50,277 --> 01:53:52,654
You and I can never be.

1067
01:54:41,036 --> 01:54:43,038
Mary Jane!

1068
01:55:46,143 --> 01:55:47,769
Hello?

1069
01:56:03,827 --> 01:56:05,162
Who's that?

1070
01:56:05,329 --> 01:56:07,247
Son.

1071
01:56:08,332 --> 01:56:09,666
I'm here.

1072
01:56:11,001 --> 01:56:12,669
Dad?

1073
01:56:13,712 --> 01:56:15,922
- I thought you were...
- No.

1074
01:56:16,423 --> 01:56:18,508
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1075
01:56:18,675 --> 01:56:19,926
Now it's your turn.

1076
01:56:21,511 --> 01:56:24,181
You swore to make
Spider-Man pay.

1077
01:56:24,514 --> 01:56:26,183
Now make him pay.

1078
01:56:26,683 --> 01:56:28,352
But Pete's my best friend.

1079
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:30,062
And I'm your father.

1080
01:56:31,063 --> 01:56:32,522
You're weak.

1081
01:56:33,523 --> 01:56:37,861
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

1082
01:56:38,904 --> 01:56:41,740
Now you know the truth
about Peter.

1083
01:56:42,699 --> 01:56:44,201
Be strong, Harry.

1084
01:56:45,202 --> 01:56:46,620
Avenge me.

1085
01:56:49,456 --> 01:56:51,500
- Avenge me!
- No!

1086
01:59:16,144 --> 01:59:17,521
Call Deborah.

1087
01:59:17,687 --> 01:59:19,523
The...? The caterer?

1088
01:59:20,524 --> 01:59:22,651
Tell her not to open the caviar.

1089
02:00:04,025 --> 02:00:06,194
Had to do what I had to do.

1090
02:00:07,863 --> 02:00:09,197
Mary Jane.

1091
02:00:10,365 --> 02:00:11,616
Peter.

1092
02:00:12,868 --> 02:00:15,287
I can't survive without you.

1093
02:00:25,297 --> 02:00:27,132
You shouldn't be here.

1094
02:00:28,258 --> 02:00:31,303
I know you think
we can't be together.

1095
02:00:32,429 --> 02:00:36,099
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1096
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:39,185
I know there'll be risks.

1097
02:00:40,020 --> 02:00:42,606
But I want to face them
with you.

1098
02:00:43,773 --> 02:00:47,110
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive,

1099
02:00:47,277 --> 02:00:49,070
half of ourselves.

1100
02:00:51,531 --> 02:00:53,116
I love you.

1101
02:00:55,452 --> 02:00:58,371
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.

1102
02:01:00,123 --> 02:01:03,209
I've always been
standing in your doorway.

1103
02:01:10,258 --> 02:01:13,803
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?

1104
02:01:19,726 --> 02:01:21,561
Well, say something.

1105
02:01:24,064 --> 02:01:26,566
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.

1106
02:01:42,749 --> 02:01:44,501
Go get them, tiger.
