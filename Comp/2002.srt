1
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,150
Who am I?

2
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:09,017
You sure you wanna know?

3
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:12,181
The story of my life is not
for the faint of heart.

4
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:15,422
If somebody said it was
a happy little tale...

5
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:19,984
if somebody told you I was just your
average guy, not a care in the world...

6
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:21,664
somebody lied.

7
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:24,281
But let me assure you,

8
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,671
this like any story worth telling...

9
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:28,214
is all about a girl.

10
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:29,911
That girl.

11
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,496
The girl next door.

12
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:33,437
Mary Jane Watson.

13
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,627
The woman I've loved since
before I even liked girls.

14
00:03:36,931 --> 00:03:39,259
I'd like to tell you that's me next to her.

15
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:41,468
Aw, heck, I'd even take him.

16
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:43,925
Hey!

17
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:45,226
Stop the bus!

18
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:47,774
That's me.

19
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:50,027
Tell him to stop! Please!

20
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:51,194
Stop!

21
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,602
Hey! Stop the bus!

22
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:54,644
Stop the bus!

23
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,070
He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Boulevard.

24
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:58,536
Catch a cab, Parker!

25
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:04,555
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

26
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:12,467
What a geek!

27
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:14,581
Don't even think about it.

28
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:16,652
You're so lame, Parker.

29
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:19,307
Would you date him?

30
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,631
Midtown High seniors.

31
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,690
No wandering.

32
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:42,583
Proceed direct. Knock it off.

33
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:46,419
Remember, it is a privilege to be here.

34
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:50,546
We're guests of Columbia
University's Science Department.

35
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:52,188
So behave accordingly.

36
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,511
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

37
00:04:56,344 --> 00:04:57,970
Come on, people, stay together.

38
00:04:58,137 --> 00:05:00,394
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

39
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:04,504
Where were you?
Checking out the library.

40
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:07,373
Looking at the books.
Yeah, right.

41
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:12,109
Charles, can we drive
around the corner, please?

42
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:13,276
Why?

43
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:15,571
The entrance is right there.

44
00:05:15,738 --> 00:05:19,450
Dad, these are public-school kids.
I'm not showing up in the Rolls.

45
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:22,199
What, you want me to trade in
my car for a Jetta...

46
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:25,264
because you flunked out of every
private school I sent you to?

47
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:26,319
It wasn't for me.

48
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:27,601
Of course it was.

49
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:30,770
Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.

50
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,359
I'm not ashamed of who I am.

51
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:34,506
It's just...

52
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:35,951
Just what, Harry?

53
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:37,634
Forget it.

54
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:41,911
Pete!

55
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,559
Hi, Harry.
Hey, man. What's up?

56
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:45,725
Harry.

57
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:47,465
Won't you be needing this?

58
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:48,918
Thanks, Dad.

59
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:51,816
Peter, may I introduce
my father, Norman Osborn.

60
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,597
I've heard so much about you.

61
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,056
Great honor to meet you, sir.

62
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,170
Harry says you're a science whiz.

63
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:57,976
You know,

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,157
I'm something of a scientist myself.

65
00:06:00,324 --> 00:06:03,494
I read all your research on nanotechnology.
Really brilliant.

66
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:04,774
And you understood it?

67
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,747
Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

68
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:07,914
Impressive.

69
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:09,959
Your parents must be very proud.

70
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:11,926
I live with my aunt and uncle.
They are.

71
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,758
Hey, you two! Let's move!

72
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:16,119
Nice to meet you.

73
00:06:16,682 --> 00:06:17,830
Hope to see you again.
Yeah.

74
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:22,500
He doesn't seem so bad.

75
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,189
Not if you're a genius.

76
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,241
I think he wants to adopt you.

77
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:28,715
There are over 32,000,

78
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:31,436
known species of spiders in the world.

79
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:33,595
They're in the order Araneae,

80
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:35,585
divided into three suborders.

81
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:36,814
That's amazing!

82
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:41,157
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.

83
00:06:41,324 --> 00:06:42,381
It's unreal.

84
00:06:43,534 --> 00:06:44,522
Arachnids,

85
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:46,006
from all three groups possess,

86
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,428
varying strengths which help
them in their constant search for food.

87
00:06:49,915 --> 00:06:50,820
For example,

88
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,447
the Delena spider,

89
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,149
family Sparassidae...

90
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:55,867
has the ability,

91
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,089
to jump to catch its prey.

92
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:00,121
For the school paper?

93
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:06,586
Next we have,

94
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:08,129
the net web spider,

95
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,269
family Filistatidae...

96
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:12,182
genus Kukulcania.

97
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:14,928
It spins an intricate funnel shaped web

98
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:17,427
whose strands have a tensile strength,

99
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:20,475
proportionately equal to a type
of high tension wire

100
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,291
used in bridge building.

101
00:07:22,823 --> 00:07:24,533
Leave him alone.
Or what?

102
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,976
Or his father will fire your father.

103
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,359
What's Daddy gonna do?

104
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,414
Sue me?

105
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:32,071
What is going on?

106
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:34,948
The next person who talks
will fail this course.

107
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:36,261
I kid you not.

108
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:37,916
This grass spider...
Let's go.

109
00:07:38,018 --> 00:07:40,036
Hunts using a set of reflexes

110
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,853
with nerve conduction velocity so fast,

111
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:46,555
that some researchers believe
that it almost borders on precognition.

112
00:07:46,763 --> 00:07:48,765
An early awareness of danger.
Those guys are jerks.

113
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:50,892
A spider-sense.

114
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:52,981
Hey, look at that spider.

115
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:56,989
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

116
00:07:58,025 --> 00:07:59,519
It's a defense mechanism.

117
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,110
Peter,

118
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:03,404
what makes you think
I would want to know that?

119
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:04,457
Who wouldn't?

120
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:06,980
Over five painstaking years,

121
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:09,158
Columbia's genetic research facility...

122
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:10,400
You gonna talk to her now?

123
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:13,504
No. Come on. You talk to her.

124
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:15,504
Armed with these DNA blueprints...

125
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:18,478
we have now begun what
was once thought impossible.

126
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:19,617
Disgusting.

127
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,990
Yeah, hateful little things.

128
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:23,758
I love them!

129
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:25,319
Yeah, me too.

130
00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:27,929
You know,

131
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:30,232
spiders can change their color...

132
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:32,756
to blend into their environment.

133
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:34,302
Really?

134
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:37,260
Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.

135
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,449
Cool.
Yeah.

136
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:42,520
Transfer RNA to encode
an entirely new genome

137
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:45,988
combining the genetic information
rom all three spiders

138
00:08:46,156 --> 00:08:46,811
into these,

139
00:08:46,835 --> 00:08:50,327
15 genetically designed super-spiders.

140
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,829
There's 14.

141
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:53,955
I beg your pardon?

142
00:08:54,498 --> 00:08:55,498
One's missing.

143
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:56,979
Yeah.

144
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:02,588
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

145
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:06,518
Do you know that this is
the largest electron microscope

146
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:07,927
on the Eastern Seaboard?

147
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:11,315
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

148
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:13,975
Let's go talk about how we listen.

149
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:18,760
Now,

150
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:21,641
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

151
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:24,359
but at Midtown High...
112.5.

152
00:09:30,594 --> 00:09:31,594
Hey.

153
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:34,067
Could I take your picture?

154
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:35,820
I need one with a student in it.

155
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:37,821
Sure, yeah.

156
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:38,988
Great.
Where do you want me?

157
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:40,606
Over here?

158
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:42,128
Yeah. Yeah that's great.

159
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:43,817
Don't make me look ugly.

160
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:46,105
That's impossible.

161
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:54,963
Perfect.

162
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:04,087
Is that good?
Great.

163
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:10,781
That's great.

164
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:18,234
MJ, let's go!

165
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:21,292
Wait.

166
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:22,445
Thanks!

167
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,350
Parker,

168
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:38,968
let's do it.

169
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:57,525
We solved the horizon glide,

170
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:59,288
and the multi-G balance issues.

171
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:01,572
I've already seen the glider.

172
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,314
That's not what I'm here for.

173
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,590
General Slocum,
good to see you again.

174
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:10,341
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

175
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,289
Norman.

176
00:11:11,383 --> 00:11:12,394
Mr. Osborn.

177
00:11:12,594 --> 00:11:16,138
Always a pleasure to have our board
of directors pay us a little visit.

178
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:19,767
I want to see the progress report
on human performance enhancers.

179
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,692
We tried vapor inhalation
with rogue subjects,

180
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,438
they showed an 800% increase in strength!

181
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:26,364
800%? That's excellent.
Any side effects?

182
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,770
In one trial, yes.

183
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:28,723
It was an aberration.

184
00:11:28,747 --> 00:11:30,591
All the tests since
then have been successful.

185
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:32,936
And in the trial that went wrong,
what happened?

186
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,287
What were the side effects?

187
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:35,587
Violence,

188
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:36,810
aggression...

189
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:38,810
and insanity.

190
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,193
And what do you recommend?

191
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:41,724
That was only one test.

192
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:43,821
With the exception of Dr. Stromm,

193
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:46,014
our entire staff certifies the product

194
00:11:46,086 --> 00:11:47,533
ready for human testing.

195
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:48,991
Dr. Stromm?

196
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,613
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

197
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:56,459
Back to formula?

198
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,504
Dr. Osborn.

199
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:00,229
I'm gonna be frank with you.

200
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:02,966
I never supported your program.

201
00:12:03,284 --> 00:12:05,440
We have my predecessor
to thank for that.

202
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:06,511
Norman,

203
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:08,834
the general gave
the go-ahead to Quest Aerospace

204
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:11,377
to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.

205
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:13,393
They test in two weeks.

206
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:16,771
And if your so-called performance
enhancers have not had a...

207
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:19,721
successful human trial by that date,

208
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:21,859
I'm gonna pull your funding.

209
00:12:22,328 --> 00:12:23,750
I'm going to give it to them.

210
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:28,023
Gentlemen. Ladies.

211
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:35,540
And the Lord said, Let there be light.

212
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:36,708
And voilà!

213
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:38,342
There is light.

214
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:41,302
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

215
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:43,798
Good boy. God will be thrilled.

216
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:45,425
Just don't fall on your ass.

217
00:12:46,563 --> 00:12:48,597
I'm already on my ass, May.

218
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:52,098
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after...

219
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:55,226
after 35 years,
what else would you call it?

220
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,832
I am on my ass.

221
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:58,482
Hand me that dish. The green one.

222
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:02,138
The corporation is
downsizing the people and...

223
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:03,911
upsizing their profits.

224
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:06,982
Ben, you'll get
another job somewhere.

225
00:13:08,712 --> 00:13:09,712
Well...

226
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:11,589
let's look in the paper and see.

227
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:14,832
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

228
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,645
Computer...

229
00:13:17,427 --> 00:13:18,985
Computer salesman,

230
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:21,338
computer engineer, computer analyst.

231
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:24,454
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

232
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:26,924
May, I'm 68 years old.

233
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:30,689
I'm too old for computers and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

234
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,095
I love you.

235
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:33,776
And Peter loves you.

236
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:37,279
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

237
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:39,187
We've been down-and-out before.

238
00:13:39,211 --> 00:13:41,047
But somehow, we survived.

239
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,399
Yeah.

240
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:44,108
Hi, sweetie.

241
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:45,132
You're just...

242
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:47,373
Just in time for dinner.

243
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:48,279
Hey.

244
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:50,125
How you doing, buddy?
How was the field trip?

245
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:52,285
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

246
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:54,167
You won't have a bite?

247
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:55,730
No thanks. Had a bite.

248
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:58,341
Did, did you get some pictures, Peter?

249
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:01,364
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

250
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:04,535
What's that all about?

251
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:28,539
In this recombination lab,

252
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:33,335
we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome

253
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:36,732
combining the genetic
information from all three spiders

254
00:14:36,798 --> 00:14:41,107
into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

255
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,265
Dr. Osborn, please.

256
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:59,785
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

257
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:02,453
The data just doesn't justify this test.

258
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,439
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.

259
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:07,203
We can't do this.

260
00:15:07,537 --> 00:15:09,255
Don't be a coward.

261
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:12,791
Risks are part of laboratory science.

262
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:14,107
Let me reschedule,

263
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,712
with a proper medical staff
and a volunteer.

264
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:19,078
I mean if you just give me two weeks.
Two weeks?

265
00:15:19,571 --> 00:15:20,525
In two weeks,

266
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,785
we'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

267
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:25,001
Sometimes,

268
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,746
you gotta do things yourself.

269
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,005
Get me the Promachloraperazine.

270
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:30,084
For what?

271
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:33,077
It begins catalyzation, when
the vapor hits the bloodstream.

272
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,406
40,000 years of evolution

273
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:41,859
and we've barely even tapped
the vastness of human potential.

274
00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:57,617
That's cold.

275
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:57,146
Norman?

276
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:02,651
Norman!

277
00:17:04,018 --> 00:17:05,018
Norman!

278
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,530
My God.

279
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:17,499
Oh my God!

280
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,100
Norman?

281
00:17:20,295 --> 00:17:22,045
My God, Norman!

282
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:25,531
Norman!

283
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:40,272
Back to formula?

284
00:18:14,948 --> 00:18:15,948
Weird.

285
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:28,862
Peter?
Yeah?

286
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:30,330
Are you alright?

287
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:33,742
I'm fine.

288
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:36,787
Any better this morning?
Any change?

289
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:37,955
Change?

290
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:40,332
Yep.

291
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:41,392
Big change.

292
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:42,656
Well, hurry up.

293
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:44,075
You're gonna be late.

294
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:45,216
Right.

295
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:04,815
Ok.

296
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:10,601
Goodness me!

297
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,625
Jeez.

298
00:19:12,273 --> 00:19:13,843
I thought you were sick.

299
00:19:14,242 --> 00:19:15,576
I got better.
You see?

300
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:16,565
Bye, guys.

301
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,793
You haven't eaten anything.
Have you got your lunch money?

302
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:19,524
Yeah, I got it.

303
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:22,655
Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget, we're
painting the kitchen right after school.

304
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,323
You got it?
Sure thing, Uncle Ben.

305
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:25,784
Don't start without me.

306
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,174
And don't start up with me.

307
00:19:29,507 --> 00:19:30,507
Teenagers.

308
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,744
Raging hormones.
They never change.

309
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:35,945
Mary jane talk to me!

310
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,526
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!

311
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,463
Just like her!

312
00:19:38,488 --> 00:19:40,370
I have to go to school.
Who's stopping you?

313
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:00,287
Hi, MJ.

314
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:02,831
Hey, MJ.

315
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,573
I don't know if you realize this,
but we've...

316
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,378
we've been neighbors since I was 6,
and I was wondering if maybe...

317
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,816
we could get together sometime?
Hey M.J?

318
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:13,036
I got the car. Hop in.

319
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:14,301
Maybe do something fun?
Hi guys!

320
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,301
Or I don't know.
Come on.

321
00:20:16,326 --> 00:20:19,077
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

322
00:20:20,475 --> 00:20:21,475
Or not.

323
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,119
Sorry Parker, the bus is full!
Hey!

324
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,104
Hey!

325
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:33,252
Stop the bus!
Catch a cab!

326
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,341
Tell him to stop.

327
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:38,131
Check him out!
Dork!

328
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:02,182
Dad!

329
00:21:02,892 --> 00:21:03,339
Dad!

330
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:04,464
Are you alright?

331
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:06,603
Harry.

332
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:11,754
What are you doing on the floor?

333
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:13,332
I don't know.

334
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,887
Have you been there all night?

335
00:21:18,908 --> 00:21:20,158
Last night I was...

336
00:21:22,495 --> 00:21:23,495
What?

337
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:26,865
I don't remember.
Mr. Osborn?

338
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,990
Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.

339
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,741
Sorry, my father's not feeling well.

340
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:31,992
Mr. Osborn...

341
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:33,654
Dr. Stromm is dead.

342
00:21:33,897 --> 00:21:34,897
What?

343
00:21:34,986 --> 00:21:36,872
They found his body
this morning in the lab.

344
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,727
He's been murdered, sir.

345
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,042
What are you talking about?

346
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:41,889
And the flight suit and the glider...

347
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,170
What about it?

348
00:21:43,194 --> 00:21:44,474
It's been stolen, sir.

349
00:22:10,418 --> 00:22:11,645
Great reflexes!

350
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:13,701
Thanks.

351
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:14,871
No problem.

352
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:17,299
Hey you...

353
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,289
have blue eyes.

354
00:22:18,313 --> 00:22:20,218
I... I didn't notice without your glasses.

355
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,400
You just get contacts?

356
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:30,395
Well,

357
00:22:30,477 --> 00:22:31,477
see you.

358
00:23:13,356 --> 00:23:14,428
What happened?

359
00:23:15,035 --> 00:23:16,121
He's freaking weird.

360
00:23:17,318 --> 00:23:18,693
Did you see that?

361
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,279
Parker?

362
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:55,895
It's a fight!
Think you're pretty funny, don't you freak?

363
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,513
Flash, it was just an accident.

364
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,502
My fist breaking your
teeth, that's the accident.

365
00:23:59,527 --> 00:24:00,933
Come on Flash, stop.

366
00:24:00,957 --> 00:24:02,237
I don't wanna fight you, Flash.

367
00:24:02,262 --> 00:24:03,685
I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.

368
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:04,964
Kick his ass.

369
00:24:25,094 --> 00:24:26,136
Help him, Harry.

370
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,291
How'd he do that?

371
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:34,603
Which one?

372
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:36,104
He's all yours, man.

373
00:24:51,996 --> 00:24:53,359
Flash, get up!

374
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,383
Jesus Parker, you are a freak.

375
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:01,107
Peter, that was amazing.

376
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:04,329
I'm out of here. Come on.

377
00:25:07,837 --> 00:25:08,837
Peter.

378
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:50,809
Go, web!

379
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:53,616
Fly.

380
00:26:55,828 --> 00:26:57,184
Up, up and away, web.

381
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:00,516
Shazam!

382
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:01,989
Go!

383
00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:02,673
Go!

384
00:27:02,918 --> 00:27:03,946
Go, web, go!

385
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,932
Tallyho.

386
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:25,961
Is she back with the beer yet?
What?

387
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:27,585
Come here, bring me some beer!

388
00:28:27,795 --> 00:28:29,117
Get up off your ass!

389
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,338
I paid for beer...

390
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:31,863
Stop yelling!
Stop it!

391
00:28:32,033 --> 00:28:33,413
You're as stupid as your mother.

392
00:28:33,437 --> 00:28:34,437
Get away from me!

393
00:28:34,677 --> 00:28:36,261
You are drunk, do you know that?

394
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:38,139
Where's she going?
Where you going?

395
00:28:38,164 --> 00:28:39,164
Where you going?

396
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,504
Stop, look!

397
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:41,838
These dishes are not done.

398
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:43,393
Somebody's gotta do the dishes!

399
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:45,342
Why don't you do them?

400
00:28:45,366 --> 00:28:47,750
Get in here little girl
and you do the dishes, now!

401
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:50,992
You do them. They're yours, anyway.
I'm going out!

402
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:52,641
Were you listening to that?

403
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:53,665
No.

404
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,019
Well I heard, but I was just...

405
00:28:56,175 --> 00:28:57,664
taking out the trash.

406
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,178
I guess you can always hear us.

407
00:28:59,681 --> 00:29:00,299
Well,

408
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:02,108
everybody shouts.

409
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:04,535
Your aunt and uncle don't.

410
00:29:05,207 --> 00:29:07,590
They can scream
pretty good sometimes.

411
00:29:09,712 --> 00:29:10,356
Listen,

412
00:29:10,725 --> 00:29:12,160
MJ, about today

413
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:14,150
at school with Flash...

414
00:29:14,175 --> 00:29:15,615
You really freaked us out.

415
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,010
I'm sorry.

416
00:29:17,178 --> 00:29:18,178
Is he ok?

417
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:21,133
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

418
00:29:25,603 --> 00:29:27,329
So where are you going
after you graduate?

419
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,930
I...

420
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:35,336
I wanna move into the city.

421
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,061
And hopefully...

422
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:39,730
get a job as a...

423
00:29:40,366 --> 00:29:41,366
photographer.

424
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:43,374
Work my way through college.

425
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:46,581
What about you?

426
00:29:47,082 --> 00:29:48,465
Headed for the city too.

427
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:51,637
Can't wait to get out of here.

428
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:54,214
I wanna...

429
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:56,966
What?

430
00:30:00,304 --> 00:30:01,304
No, come on.

431
00:30:01,954 --> 00:30:02,954
Try me.

432
00:30:03,474 --> 00:30:04,474
I wanna...

433
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:07,101
Act...

434
00:30:08,604 --> 00:30:09,604
on stage.

435
00:30:10,606 --> 00:30:11,606
Really?

436
00:30:12,816 --> 00:30:14,184
That's perfect.

437
00:30:15,277 --> 00:30:17,886
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

438
00:30:18,155 --> 00:30:18,852
Really?

439
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:19,876
Yeah.

440
00:30:20,658 --> 00:30:23,660
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

441
00:30:24,111 --> 00:30:25,690
Peter, that was first grade.

442
00:30:26,713 --> 00:30:27,713
Well...

443
00:30:28,764 --> 00:30:29,807
even so.

444
00:30:31,377 --> 00:30:32,580
Sometimes...

445
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:35,166
you know people.

446
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:37,996
You can just...

447
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:39,597
see what's coming.

448
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:45,292
What do you see coming for you?

449
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:49,885
I don't know.

450
00:30:52,982 --> 00:30:54,012
Whatever it is,

451
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,768
it's something I never felt before.

452
00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:02,169
And...

453
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:03,700
what for me?

454
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:05,123
For you?

455
00:31:06,993 --> 00:31:08,568
You're gonna light up Broadway.

456
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,333
You know,

457
00:31:16,953 --> 00:31:18,631
you're taller than you look.

458
00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:20,842
I hunch.

459
00:31:23,637 --> 00:31:24,637
Don't.

460
00:31:28,684 --> 00:31:29,684
Hey, MJ!

461
00:31:29,894 --> 00:31:32,246
Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

462
00:31:33,314 --> 00:31:34,314
Come on!

463
00:31:35,357 --> 00:31:36,363
I gotta go.

464
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,599
Bye.

465
00:31:39,695 --> 00:31:42,363
My God, it's gorgeous!
Yeah, right?

466
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:44,138
Look at it!
Hop in.

467
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,671
Oh my God! What a cool car!

468
00:31:47,202 --> 00:31:48,202
Pretty tight?

469
00:31:49,204 --> 00:31:51,027
Wait untill you hear the sound system.

470
00:31:51,051 --> 00:31:53,100
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

471
00:31:55,044 --> 00:31:56,044
Cool car.

472
00:33:26,699 --> 00:33:27,699
Peter?

473
00:33:29,263 --> 00:33:31,490
What's... What's going on in there?

474
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:32,545
I'm exercising.

475
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:33,855
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

476
00:33:34,207 --> 00:33:34,923
Well,

477
00:33:35,206 --> 00:33:37,277
you're acting so strangely, Peter.

478
00:33:38,272 --> 00:33:39,706
Ok. Thanks.

479
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,252
Something's bothering him.

480
00:34:12,502 --> 00:34:14,515
Maybe he's too embarrassed
to tell me what it is.

481
00:34:14,683 --> 00:34:15,803
Maybe I'm too embarrassed...

482
00:34:16,274 --> 00:34:17,470
to ask him.

483
00:34:18,145 --> 00:34:19,720
I just don't know anymore.

484
00:34:20,606 --> 00:34:23,017
I'm going to the downtown library.
I'll see you later.

485
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:23,888
Yeah, wait Pete.

486
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:25,557
I'll drive you there, buddy.

487
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:26,602
No, I'll take the train.

488
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:28,059
No, no, no. I need the exercise.
Go on.

489
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,346
Go, go, go, go.

490
00:34:40,983 --> 00:34:42,574
Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
No, wait a minute.

491
00:34:42,598 --> 00:34:44,443
Peter we need... we need to talk.

492
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:46,036
We can talk later.

493
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:47,663
Well, we can talk now.

494
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:49,631
If you let me.

495
00:34:50,093 --> 00:34:52,303
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

496
00:34:52,471 --> 00:34:54,489
Because we haven't talked
at all for so long

497
00:34:54,514 --> 00:34:56,739
your Aunt May and I don't
even know who you are anymore.

498
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:58,396
You shirk your chores.

499
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:01,842
You have all those weird experiments
in your room.

500
00:35:02,412 --> 00:35:05,693
You start fights at school, you know.
I didn't start that fight, I told you that.

501
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,515
Well, you sure as hell finished it.

502
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:09,621
What was I supposed to do, run away?
No.

503
00:35:09,646 --> 00:35:11,552
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...

504
00:35:12,574 --> 00:35:13,438
Pete, look.

505
00:35:13,462 --> 00:35:14,355
You're changing.

506
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:17,161
I know, I went through exactly
the same thing at your age.

507
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:18,708
No. Not exactly.

508
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:20,187
Peter...

509
00:35:20,707 --> 00:35:23,200
these are the years
when a man changes

510
00:35:23,428 --> 00:35:26,576
into the man he's gonna
become the rest of his life.

511
00:35:27,927 --> 00:35:30,220
Just be careful who you change into.

512
00:35:32,386 --> 00:35:34,333
This guy, Flash Thompson.

513
00:35:34,651 --> 00:35:36,889
He probably deserved what happened.

514
00:35:37,432 --> 00:35:39,565
But just because you can beat him up,

515
00:35:40,602 --> 00:35:42,047
doesn't give you the right to.

516
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,430
Remember,

517
00:35:44,734 --> 00:35:45,970
with great power,

518
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:48,422
comes great responsibility.

519
00:35:49,361 --> 00:35:52,268
Are you afraid that I'm gonna
turn into some kind of criminal?

520
00:35:52,743 --> 00:35:54,275
Quit worrying about me, ok?

521
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,480
Something's different.

522
00:35:55,504 --> 00:35:56,648
I'll figure it out.

523
00:35:56,672 --> 00:35:58,226
Stop lecturing me, please.

524
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,527
I don't mean to lecture,
I don't mean to preach.

525
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:02,599
And I know I'm not your father...

526
00:36:02,624 --> 00:36:04,281
Then stop pretending to be!

527
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:10,548
Right.

528
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,171
I'll pick you up here at 10.

529
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:54,163
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

530
00:36:57,106 --> 00:36:58,877
One, two, three.

531
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:00,785
That's it!
Who's the man?

532
00:37:00,981 --> 00:37:05,270
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

533
00:37:05,687 --> 00:37:07,897
Ladies and gentlemen...

534
00:37:08,065 --> 00:37:12,610
Give it up for Bone Saw McGraw!

535
00:37:15,697 --> 00:37:18,566
For $3000,

536
00:37:19,534 --> 00:37:22,652
is there no one here
man enough to stay in the ring

537
00:37:22,677 --> 00:37:27,730
for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

538
00:37:30,793 --> 00:37:31,957
Who?

539
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:34,316
I know who.

540
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:39,845
The Flying Dutchman!

541
00:37:40,313 --> 00:37:41,313
Next.

542
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:44,849
There's no featherweight
division here, small fry.

543
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:45,849
. Next.

544
00:37:45,936 --> 00:37:47,169
No, no. Sign me up.

545
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:49,188
Ok.

546
00:37:49,763 --> 00:37:51,792
You understand
the NYWL is not responsible

547
00:37:51,817 --> 00:37:53,283
for any injury you may and

548
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:55,903
probably will sustain while
participating in said event?

549
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:58,352
And you are indeed participating
under your own free will?

550
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,490
Yes.

551
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:00,939
Down the hall to the ramp.

552
00:38:00,963 --> 00:38:02,190
May God be with you.

553
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,780
Next.

554
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:08,091
Told you! Told you!

555
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:10,692
Winner!

556
00:38:10,717 --> 00:38:12,052
Next victim!

557
00:38:13,672 --> 00:38:16,137
Are you ready for more?

558
00:38:17,676 --> 00:38:21,262
Bone Saw is ready!

559
00:38:23,682 --> 00:38:28,082
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

560
00:38:28,562 --> 00:38:31,761
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage

561
00:38:31,785 --> 00:38:36,391
with Bone Saw McGraw,
the sum of $3000

562
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:37,903
will be paid to...

563
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,780
What's your name, kid?

564
00:38:40,126 --> 00:38:41,368
The Human Spider.

565
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,744
The Human Spider, that's it?
That's the best you got?

566
00:38:44,911 --> 00:38:45,525
Yeah.

567
00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:46,801
That sucks.

568
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:51,709
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

569
00:38:51,877 --> 00:38:53,074
the terrifying,

570
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,129
the deadly,

571
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,847
the amazing Spider-Man!

572
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:03,596
My name's The Human Spider.
I don't care, get out there.

573
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:06,336
No, he got my name wrong.
Get out there, you moron.

574
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:12,200
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out, little man.

575
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,106
I hope you brought
your mommy with you.

576
00:39:14,131 --> 00:39:17,269
We'll break you!
You'll need someone to cry to.

577
00:39:19,112 --> 00:39:23,638
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one!

578
00:39:24,743 --> 00:39:26,786
Oh my God!

579
00:39:26,995 --> 00:39:28,034
My legs!

580
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:31,023
God. I can't feel my legs.

581
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:39,492
Kill! Kill! Kill!

582
00:39:43,512 --> 00:39:44,720
Cage!

583
00:39:54,064 --> 00:39:55,523
Hello? Guys?

584
00:39:56,566 --> 00:40:01,529
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

585
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,239
Hey, listen.

586
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,293
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

587
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:07,398
Hey!

588
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,150
Unlock the thing!

589
00:40:09,377 --> 00:40:10,444
Take the chain off!

590
00:40:10,483 --> 00:40:11,991
Hey, freak show!

591
00:40:12,415 --> 00:40:14,295
You're going, nowhere.

592
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,132
I got you for three minutes.

593
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:19,984
Three minutes of playtime.

594
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,798
What are you doing up there?
Staying away from you.

595
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,589
That's a cute outfit.

596
00:40:31,613 --> 00:40:32,935
Did your husband give it to you?

597
00:40:40,068 --> 00:40:41,127
Finish him off!

598
00:40:48,785 --> 00:40:49,879
Smash him!

599
00:40:57,502 --> 00:40:59,105
Hit him!
Harder!

600
00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:03,128
Kick his spider ass!

601
00:41:05,594 --> 00:41:06,760
Hit him!

602
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:21,984
One, two, three!

603
00:41:22,194 --> 00:41:23,266
That's it! That's it!

604
00:41:24,287 --> 00:41:25,239
Winner!

605
00:41:25,264 --> 00:41:27,687
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion,

606
00:41:27,765 --> 00:41:30,405
Spider-Man!

607
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,811
Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!

608
00:41:36,146 --> 00:41:38,704
Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!

609
00:41:47,636 --> 00:41:48,779
Now get out of here.

610
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:52,128
A hundred bucks?

611
00:41:52,152 --> 00:41:53,766
The ad said 3000.

612
00:41:53,975 --> 00:41:55,731
Well, check it again, webhead.

613
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:57,925
It said three grand,

614
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,276
for three minutes.
And you pinned him in two.

615
00:42:00,607 --> 00:42:03,581
For that, I give you 100
and you're lucky to get that.

616
00:42:04,152 --> 00:42:05,527
I need that money.

617
00:42:05,987 --> 00:42:08,278
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

618
00:42:17,165 --> 00:42:18,738
Hey, what the hell?

619
00:42:18,887 --> 00:42:20,254
Put the money in the bag.

620
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:23,219
Hurry up!

621
00:42:30,011 --> 00:42:32,262
Hey! He stole the gate!

622
00:42:32,451 --> 00:42:33,754
Stop that guy!

623
00:42:34,734 --> 00:42:36,867
Stop him! He's got my money!

624
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:38,269
Thanks.

625
00:42:39,688 --> 00:42:41,969
What the hell's the matter with you?
You let him go!

626
00:42:42,357 --> 00:42:44,566
Cut him off in the lobby
and call the cops!

627
00:42:44,734 --> 00:42:46,599
You could've taken that guy apart.

628
00:42:46,623 --> 00:42:48,779
Now he's gonna get away
with my money.

629
00:42:48,947 --> 00:42:50,958
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

630
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,359
Sir, you gotta get back.
Get back.

631
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:14,206
I can't see anything.
What happened?

632
00:43:14,889 --> 00:43:16,047
Old dude, man.

633
00:43:16,474 --> 00:43:18,099
Come on folks. Keep moving, please.

634
00:43:18,419 --> 00:43:19,981
Please, keep moving. Let's go!

635
00:43:20,812 --> 00:43:23,226
What happened?
Someone got hurt.

636
00:43:26,026 --> 00:43:26,764
Excuse me.

637
00:43:26,788 --> 00:43:28,599
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

638
00:43:28,623 --> 00:43:29,623
Stay back.

639
00:43:29,738 --> 00:43:31,572
Hey, stay back! Stay back!
That's my uncle!

640
00:43:33,742 --> 00:43:34,689
What happened?

641
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:36,187
Carjacker. He's been shot.

642
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,514
But we just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

643
00:43:40,248 --> 00:43:41,248
Uncle Ben?

644
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:43,542
Uncle Ben.

645
00:43:47,797 --> 00:43:48,797
Uncle Ben?

646
00:43:52,761 --> 00:43:53,761
Peter.

647
00:43:55,138 --> 00:43:56,364
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

648
00:44:02,562 --> 00:44:03,562
Peter.

649
00:44:25,752 --> 00:44:27,158
They got the shooter.

650
00:44:27,182 --> 00:44:28,924
He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.

651
00:44:29,005 --> 00:44:30,703
We got three cars in pursuit.

652
00:44:30,953 --> 00:44:33,351
Alright. Folks come on.
Come up. Move back.

653
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:12,834
Get a unit to the rear!

654
00:47:15,797 --> 00:47:17,339
I got the back!

655
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:31,410
Who's there?

656
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,786
Don't hurt me.

657
00:47:58,810 --> 00:47:59,995
Just give me a chance.

658
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:01,200
Just give me a chance!

659
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:02,373
What about my uncle?

660
00:48:02,397 --> 00:48:03,874
Did you give him a chance?

661
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:05,301
Did you?

662
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,760
Answer me!

663
00:48:10,685 --> 00:48:12,401
Stop that guy!

664
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:18,358
Thanks.

665
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,120
See you.

666
00:48:51,893 --> 00:48:52,715
Freeze!

667
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:54,963
We've got the place
completely surrounded.

668
00:49:37,855 --> 00:49:39,214
No. My God.

669
00:49:42,402 --> 00:49:44,136
No.
My God. No!

670
00:49:54,455 --> 00:49:55,527
Good evening General.

671
00:49:56,097 --> 00:49:57,097
Good to see you.

672
00:49:58,209 --> 00:50:01,086
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, General Slocum.

673
00:50:01,254 --> 00:50:05,293
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

674
00:50:07,885 --> 00:50:10,978
He's clear, let's go!
I assume you're confident about this test?

675
00:50:11,003 --> 00:50:11,794
Absolutely.

676
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:13,470
Captain Curtis is our top pilot.

677
00:50:14,142 --> 00:50:16,665
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?

678
00:50:17,061 --> 00:50:20,852
Nothing would please me more than
to put Norman Osborn out of business.

679
00:50:23,317 --> 00:50:24,515
Preflight complete.

680
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:26,125
Mark.

681
00:50:30,491 --> 00:50:33,233
We are picking up an
unidentified object, closing fast.

682
00:50:33,286 --> 00:50:34,369
What the hell is that?

683
00:50:34,537 --> 00:50:35,537
Can you see anything?

684
00:50:36,497 --> 00:50:37,497
Oh my God!

685
00:50:48,134 --> 00:50:48,956
Say chess.

686
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,277
Chess!

687
00:50:51,512 --> 00:50:52,512
Peter!

688
00:50:53,598 --> 00:50:54,378
Darling.

689
00:50:54,402 --> 00:50:57,517
I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

690
00:50:57,685 --> 00:50:58,340
Pete?

691
00:50:58,364 --> 00:51:01,772
Good news. My father got the place
in New York, so we're all set this fall.

692
00:51:01,939 --> 00:51:03,523
That's great.
You made it.

693
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:08,382
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

694
00:51:11,032 --> 00:51:12,741
Congratulations.
Thanks, Dad.

695
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:15,357
Peter, the science award.

696
00:51:15,561 --> 00:51:16,596
That's terrific.

697
00:51:16,621 --> 00:51:17,621
Yeah.

698
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:23,293
I know this has been
a difficult time for you

699
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,668
but I want you to try to enjoy this day.

700
00:51:27,882 --> 00:51:28,996
Commencement.

701
00:51:29,592 --> 00:51:30,956
The end of one thing.

702
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:33,121
The start of something new.

703
00:51:35,556 --> 00:51:36,962
I don't want to be with you anymore.

704
00:51:36,986 --> 00:51:38,720
Here's your ring.

705
00:51:40,102 --> 00:51:41,477
You know what? Whatever.

706
00:51:42,522 --> 00:51:43,522
Your loss.

707
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,096
You're like a brother to Harry.

708
00:51:46,484 --> 00:51:47,727
That makes you family.

709
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,350
And if you ever need anything just...

710
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:51,530
give me a call.

711
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:05,790
Can I...

712
00:52:06,128 --> 00:52:07,422
Can I fix you something?

713
00:52:08,548 --> 00:52:09,548
No, thanks.

714
00:52:54,802 --> 00:52:56,335
I missed him a lot today.

715
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,520
I know.

716
00:53:02,852 --> 00:53:03,961
I miss him too.

717
00:53:06,439 --> 00:53:08,148
But he was there.

718
00:53:11,944 --> 00:53:14,393
I can't help thinking about...

719
00:53:15,551 --> 00:53:17,293
the last thing I said to him.

720
00:53:17,372 --> 00:53:19,481
He tried to tell me something
important,

721
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,777
and I threw it in his face.

722
00:53:24,123 --> 00:53:25,511
You loved him

723
00:53:27,877 --> 00:53:29,341
and he loved you.

724
00:53:31,005 --> 00:53:33,599
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

725
00:53:34,842 --> 00:53:37,115
How you were meant for great things.

726
00:53:38,846 --> 00:53:40,348
You won't disappoint him.

727
00:54:14,715 --> 00:54:15,913
With great power...

728
00:54:16,574 --> 00:54:18,550
comes great responsibility.

729
00:54:19,053 --> 00:54:20,250
Remember that, Pete.

730
00:54:20,696 --> 00:54:21,847
Remember that.

731
00:54:32,274 --> 00:54:33,307
Hurry up!

732
00:54:45,913 --> 00:54:46,994
This is not a man.

733
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:49,619
My brother saw him building a
nest in the Lincoln Center Fountain.

734
00:54:49,834 --> 00:54:51,114
I think he's human,

735
00:54:51,138 --> 00:54:53,115
I think he's a man.
Could be a woman.

736
00:54:57,038 --> 00:54:57,871
Bobby.

737
00:54:57,895 --> 00:54:59,247
Get a load of this!

738
00:55:03,143 --> 00:55:05,019
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out,

739
00:55:05,266 --> 00:55:07,366
and he climbs up
the ropes like a spider web.

740
00:55:07,601 --> 00:55:09,508
I see the web and it's his signature,

741
00:55:09,532 --> 00:55:11,872
and I know Spider-Man was here.

742
00:55:11,897 --> 00:55:13,345
The guy protects us, you know?

743
00:55:13,369 --> 00:55:14,524
He protects the people.

744
00:55:14,692 --> 00:55:17,444
Some kind of freakyloo or something.
Wackadoo.

745
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:19,612
He stinks and I don't like him.

746
00:55:20,364 --> 00:55:21,434
Don't move, lady!

747
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:31,154
Guy with eight hands.

748
00:55:31,683 --> 00:55:32,792
Sounds hot.

749
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:34,987
He has those tights
and that tight little...

750
00:55:51,062 --> 00:55:52,634
Who is Spider-Man?

751
00:55:52,658 --> 00:55:54,356
He's a criminal, that's who he is!

752
00:55:54,982 --> 00:55:55,846
A vigilante.

753
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,014
A public menace.

754
00:55:57,038 --> 00:55:58,772
What's he doing on my front page?

755
00:55:58,952 --> 00:56:01,248
Mr. Jameson, your wife's on line one.
She needs to know if you...

756
00:56:01,272 --> 00:56:02,716
Mr. Jameson, there's a page six problem.

757
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,389
We have a page one problem. Shut up.

758
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,062
Well?
He's news.

759
00:56:06,577 --> 00:56:09,139
They're really important clients.
They can't wait. They're about to.

760
00:56:09,163 --> 00:56:11,570
He pulled six people off that subway car.

761
00:56:11,594 --> 00:56:13,249
Sure, from a wreck he probably caused.

762
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:15,228
Something goes wrong
and this creepy crawler is there.

763
00:56:15,252 --> 00:56:17,587
Look at that. He's fleeing the scene!
What's that tell ya?

764
00:56:17,755 --> 00:56:20,507
He's not fleeing, he's probably
going to save somebody else.

765
00:56:20,535 --> 00:56:21,817
He's a hero!

766
00:56:21,842 --> 00:56:23,002
Then why does he wear a mask?

767
00:56:23,776 --> 00:56:24,786
What's he got to hide?

768
00:56:24,845 --> 00:56:27,807
She just needs to know if you want the
chintz or the chenille in the dining room.

769
00:56:27,831 --> 00:56:28,879
Whichever one's cheaper.

770
00:56:28,903 --> 00:56:30,534
Mr. Jameson, it's like this.

771
00:56:30,684 --> 00:56:32,151
We double-booked page six.

772
00:56:32,186 --> 00:56:34,522
See, so both Macy's and Conway's
both have three quarters...

773
00:56:34,546 --> 00:56:36,511
We sold out four printings.

774
00:56:37,382 --> 00:56:38,125
Sold out?

775
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:39,400
Every copy.

776
00:56:39,914 --> 00:56:42,487
Tomorrow morning, Spider-Man,
page one with a decent picture this time.

777
00:56:42,511 --> 00:56:44,254
Move Conway to page 7.
There's a problem with page 7...

778
00:56:44,278 --> 00:56:46,843
And make it page eight, get him
10 percent off. Make it five percent.

779
00:56:46,867 --> 00:56:48,284
That can't be done.
Get outta here!

780
00:56:48,744 --> 00:56:50,796
The problem is,
we don't have a decent picture.

781
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:53,675
Eddie's been on it for weeks,
we can barely get a glimpse of him.

782
00:56:54,058 --> 00:56:55,237
What is he, shy?

783
00:56:56,043 --> 00:56:59,923
If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a
thong, we can surely get a picture with this weirdo.

784
00:57:00,104 --> 00:57:01,286
Put an ad on the front page.

785
00:57:01,388 --> 00:57:03,135
Cash money for a picture of Spider-Man.

786
00:57:03,801 --> 00:57:05,082
He doesn't wanna be famous?

787
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:07,262
I'll make him infamous!

788
00:57:18,482 --> 00:57:19,482
Hey!

789
00:57:19,733 --> 00:57:20,733
Buzz off.

790
00:57:21,861 --> 00:57:23,391
MJ, it's me, Peter.

791
00:57:23,415 --> 00:57:24,415
Hi!

792
00:57:24,463 --> 00:57:25,463
Hey.

793
00:57:26,532 --> 00:57:27,700
What are you doing around here?

794
00:57:27,724 --> 00:57:30,188
I'm begging for a job.
How about you?

795
00:57:31,912 --> 00:57:33,360
I'm headed to an audition.

796
00:57:33,384 --> 00:57:34,384
An audition?

797
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,820
So you're acting now?

798
00:57:35,939 --> 00:57:36,939
Yeah.

799
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,323
I work steady.

800
00:57:38,797 --> 00:57:40,920
In fact, I just got off a job.

801
00:57:41,182 --> 00:57:42,349
That's great, MJ!

802
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,870
You're doing it!

803
00:57:44,058 --> 00:57:45,737
You're living your dream!
Hey, glamour girl!

804
00:57:45,761 --> 00:57:47,844
Yeah.
Your drawer was short $6!

805
00:57:48,012 --> 00:57:49,167
Next time that happens,

806
00:57:49,191 --> 00:57:50,638
I'mma take it out of your check.

807
00:57:51,724 --> 00:57:53,213
Excuse me, Miss Watson?

808
00:57:53,464 --> 00:57:54,631
I'm talking to you!

809
00:57:54,655 --> 00:57:55,655
Hey!

810
00:57:55,728 --> 00:57:57,948
Yes, Enrique! Ok? I get you.

811
00:57:57,973 --> 00:57:59,636
Well, it better not happen
no more, you hear me?

812
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,268
Don't roll your eyes at me.

813
00:58:09,283 --> 00:58:10,292
Some dream?

814
00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:13,744
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

815
00:58:14,663 --> 00:58:15,735
Don't tell Harry.

816
00:58:15,837 --> 00:58:16,947
Don't tell Harry?

817
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:19,406
Aren't you guys living together?

818
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:21,299
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

819
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,924
Yeah. Right.

820
00:58:24,715 --> 00:58:27,800
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

821
00:58:27,968 --> 00:58:29,583
He'd think it was low or something.

822
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:30,917
It's not low.

823
00:58:31,267 --> 00:58:32,388
You have a job.

824
00:58:32,723 --> 00:58:33,894
You know Harry...

825
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:37,060
doesn't live on a little place
I like to call Earth.

826
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:40,402
No, I guess not.

827
00:58:45,486 --> 00:58:46,674
Thanks, Pete.

828
00:58:48,489 --> 00:58:49,892
We should catch up sometime.

829
00:58:54,518 --> 00:58:56,127
Let's get some lunch some evening.

830
00:58:58,415 --> 00:58:59,571
Well I...

831
00:58:59,758 --> 00:59:02,805
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

832
00:59:03,128 --> 00:59:04,409
And I won't tell Harry.

833
00:59:04,433 --> 00:59:05,838
No, don't tell Harry.

834
00:59:06,014 --> 00:59:07,014
I won't!

835
00:59:09,426 --> 00:59:10,799
I won't tell Harry.

836
00:59:22,481 --> 00:59:24,293
Timing's perfect. Hey.

837
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:26,431
Five new contracts.

838
00:59:26,455 --> 00:59:27,551
It'll be great.

839
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:33,306
Storming Norman's
making his weekly inspection.

840
00:59:34,201 --> 00:59:35,962
Spent half of it on the phone.

841
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:39,361
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help.

842
00:59:39,385 --> 00:59:40,769
I'm really lost here.

843
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:43,605
Are you alright?

844
00:59:45,269 --> 00:59:46,451
You look like you just got,

845
00:59:46,475 --> 00:59:48,316
second place in the science fair.

846
00:59:48,488 --> 00:59:49,597
No I...

847
00:59:51,074 --> 00:59:53,845
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

848
00:59:53,942 --> 00:59:55,003
You were late again?

849
00:59:56,223 --> 00:59:57,223
I don't get it.

850
00:59:57,956 --> 00:59:59,356
Wait, where do you go all the time?

851
01:00:00,352 --> 01:00:01,352
Around.

852
01:00:01,887 --> 01:00:02,887
Peter Parker.

853
01:00:03,814 --> 01:00:05,553
Maybe you'll tell me who she is.

854
01:00:05,789 --> 01:00:06,528
Who's that?

855
01:00:06,553 --> 01:00:08,651
This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
Dad.

856
01:00:09,945 --> 01:00:11,612
When do I get to meet her?
Dad.

857
01:00:11,959 --> 01:00:13,911
Well sorry, Harry hasn't mentioned her.

858
01:00:17,953 --> 01:00:19,859
Hey Pete, you're probably looking for a...

859
01:00:20,068 --> 01:00:21,257
a job now, right?

860
01:00:21,415 --> 01:00:22,985
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

861
01:00:24,418 --> 01:00:27,575
No I... I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
It's no problem.

862
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,856
I'll make a few calls.

863
01:00:28,881 --> 01:00:30,412
No, I couldn't accept it, sir.

864
01:00:30,436 --> 01:00:33,176
I like to earn what I get.
I can find my own work.

865
01:00:33,385 --> 01:00:34,385
I respect that.

866
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,807
You want to make
it on your own steam.

867
01:00:38,557 --> 01:00:39,627
That's great.

868
01:00:40,768 --> 01:00:42,557
What other skills do you have, Parker?

869
01:00:43,312 --> 01:00:45,685
I was thinking of something in photography.

870
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,400
Hello.

871
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:52,570
Let's go!

872
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:53,739
Move it!

873
01:00:55,032 --> 01:00:56,070
Watch the street!

874
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:13,132
Cheese!

875
01:01:22,434 --> 01:01:23,435
They're crap.

876
01:01:23,936 --> 01:01:24,936
Crap.

877
01:01:24,974 --> 01:01:26,607
Crap. Megacrap.

878
01:01:27,106 --> 01:01:28,636
I'll give you $200 for all of them.

879
01:01:28,845 --> 01:01:30,301
That seems a little low.

880
01:01:30,484 --> 01:01:31,731
Take them somewhere else, then.

881
01:01:32,403 --> 01:01:35,203
Sir, your wife says the tile you
ordered for the foyer is out of stock.

882
01:01:35,473 --> 01:01:36,913
Tell her we'll just put a rug there.

883
01:01:37,116 --> 01:01:37,937
Sit down.

884
01:01:37,961 --> 01:01:38,961
Give me that.

885
01:01:40,661 --> 01:01:41,733
Give you 300.

886
01:01:41,757 --> 01:01:43,204
That's the standard freelance fee.

887
01:01:43,372 --> 01:01:45,320
Tear up page one.
Run that photo instead.

888
01:01:45,344 --> 01:01:46,104
Headline?

889
01:01:46,142 --> 01:01:48,031
Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?

890
01:01:48,055 --> 01:01:49,436
Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos.

891
01:01:49,461 --> 01:01:50,283
Menace?

892
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:52,648
He was protecting that armoured...
Tell you what, Atticus.

893
01:01:52,673 --> 01:01:54,287
You take the pictures,
I'll make up the headlines. Ok?

894
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:55,485
Alright? That ok with you?

895
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,040
Yes, sir.
Goody.

896
01:01:58,011 --> 01:01:59,292
Give this to the girl up front.

897
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:00,675
She'll see you get paid.

898
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:02,837
I'd like a job, sir.

899
01:02:02,861 --> 01:02:04,589
No jobs. Freelance.

900
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:06,534
Best thing in the world for a kid your age.

901
01:02:06,812 --> 01:02:09,515
You bring me some more shots
of that newspaper-selling clown,

902
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:10,980
maybe I'll take them off your hands.

903
01:02:11,316 --> 01:02:12,597
But I never said you have a job.

904
01:02:13,226 --> 01:02:14,226
Meat.

905
01:02:14,445 --> 01:02:15,934
I'll send you a nice box
of Christmas meat,

906
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:17,227
best I can do. Get outta here.

907
01:02:17,251 --> 01:02:18,739
Bring me more photos.

908
01:02:20,325 --> 01:02:21,670
Hi.
Hi.

909
01:02:21,743 --> 01:02:24,154
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

910
01:02:26,248 --> 01:02:27,779
Welcome to the Daily Bugle.

911
01:02:27,803 --> 01:02:28,919
Thank you.

912
01:02:29,918 --> 01:02:31,294
I'm Peter Parker.

913
01:02:33,797 --> 01:02:35,091
I'm a photographer.

914
01:02:36,758 --> 01:02:37,758
Yes.

915
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:39,062
I can see that.

916
01:02:47,019 --> 01:02:48,647
As of today,

917
01:02:49,021 --> 01:02:50,468
OSCORP lndustries,

918
01:02:50,624 --> 01:02:53,156
has surpassed Quest Aerospace

919
01:02:53,275 --> 01:02:56,554
as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

920
01:02:57,863 --> 01:03:00,116
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

921
01:03:00,866 --> 01:03:02,188
costs are down,

922
01:03:02,725 --> 01:03:03,890
revenues are up,

923
01:03:04,286 --> 01:03:05,316
and our stock,

924
01:03:05,577 --> 01:03:06,904
has never been higher.

925
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:08,653
Wonderful news Norman.

926
01:03:08,677 --> 01:03:09,677
Wonderful.

927
01:03:09,858 --> 01:03:11,778
In fact, it's the reason
for selling the company.

928
01:03:12,794 --> 01:03:13,459
What?

929
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:16,703
Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing
in the wake of the bombing.

930
01:03:17,355 --> 01:03:18,355
Expanding.

931
01:03:19,384 --> 01:03:21,761
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

932
01:03:22,304 --> 01:03:23,471
Why wasn't I told?

933
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:26,087
Last thing they want
is a power struggle,

934
01:03:26,426 --> 01:03:27,879
with entrenched management.

935
01:03:28,278 --> 01:03:30,184
The deal is off if you come with it.

936
01:03:30,479 --> 01:03:33,364
The board expects
your resignation in 30 days.

937
01:03:34,184 --> 01:03:36,144
You can't do this to me.

938
01:03:39,088 --> 01:03:41,012
I started this company.

939
01:03:42,574 --> 01:03:44,777
You know how much I sacrificed?

940
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:49,830
Max.

941
01:03:49,968 --> 01:03:51,296
Please.
Norman,

942
01:03:51,678 --> 01:03:53,741
the board is unanimous.

943
01:03:54,836 --> 01:03:58,100
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

944
01:03:59,007 --> 01:04:00,053
I'm sorry.

945
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:02,905
You're out, Norman.

946
01:04:13,522 --> 01:04:14,646
Am I?

947
01:04:19,236 --> 01:04:22,279
Welcome to OSCORP lndustries
Unity Day Festival!

948
01:04:22,322 --> 01:04:24,986
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.

949
01:05:02,195 --> 01:05:03,195
MJ,

950
01:05:04,163 --> 01:05:05,698
why didn't you wear the black dress?

951
01:05:06,742 --> 01:05:08,815
Just, I wanted to impress my father.

952
01:05:09,225 --> 01:05:10,411
He loves black.

953
01:05:10,579 --> 01:05:12,944
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what.

954
01:05:13,927 --> 01:05:15,199
You think I'm pretty.

955
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:17,075
I think you're beautiful.

956
01:05:30,849 --> 01:05:32,046
MJ, would you do me a favor?

957
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:34,312
I... forgot my drink inside.
Come on.

958
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:45,685
Hi, Mr. Fargas.

959
01:05:45,709 --> 01:05:46,709
Harry.

960
01:05:47,532 --> 01:05:49,105
Have you seen my father around?

961
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:52,875
Well, I'm not sure if he's coming today.

962
01:06:04,716 --> 01:06:05,747
What is that?

963
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:07,483
Must be new this year.

964
01:06:12,513 --> 01:06:13,513
What is that?

965
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:14,677
That's our glider!

966
01:06:25,932 --> 01:06:27,391
What the hell was that?

967
01:06:55,726 --> 01:06:57,143
Code three! Code three!

968
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,544
Oh my God! Harry!
MJ!

969
01:07:21,293 --> 01:07:23,769
Harry! Help me! Harry!

970
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:32,064
Out, am I?

971
01:07:37,017 --> 01:07:38,047
Mary Jane!

972
01:07:38,071 --> 01:07:39,071
Harry!

973
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:43,970
Hello, my dear.

974
01:07:45,108 --> 01:07:46,303
It's Spider-Man!

975
01:07:58,455 --> 01:07:59,485
Come on, move, kid.

976
01:07:59,509 --> 01:08:00,509
Billy!

977
01:08:03,919 --> 01:08:05,845
Somebody help him!

978
01:08:06,463 --> 01:08:07,713
No!

979
01:08:09,508 --> 01:08:10,508
Mommy!

980
01:08:13,053 --> 01:08:14,167
Hold it right there!

981
01:08:14,191 --> 01:08:15,420
I surrender.

982
01:08:15,526 --> 01:08:16,377
Boy.

983
01:08:16,402 --> 01:08:17,402
Hold it right there!

984
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:25,272
Impressive.

985
01:08:49,422 --> 01:08:50,512
Mary Jane!

986
01:08:50,536 --> 01:08:51,662
Help!

987
01:08:51,686 --> 01:08:53,125
Someone please help me!

988
01:09:18,243 --> 01:09:19,243
Hold on!

989
01:09:20,954 --> 01:09:21,954
Watch out!

990
01:09:31,089 --> 01:09:32,662
We'll meet again,

991
01:09:33,014 --> 01:09:34,557
Spider-Man!

992
01:09:36,469 --> 01:09:37,581
Hold on, Mary Jane!

993
01:10:20,388 --> 01:10:21,043
Well,

994
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:22,622
beats taking the subway.

995
01:10:23,266 --> 01:10:25,528
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

996
01:10:26,451 --> 01:10:27,451
Wait.

997
01:10:27,979 --> 01:10:28,979
Who are you?

998
01:10:29,397 --> 01:10:30,761
You know who I am.

999
01:10:30,933 --> 01:10:31,933
I do?

1000
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,894
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

1001
01:10:46,539 --> 01:10:47,539
Incredible?

1002
01:10:48,582 --> 01:10:49,936
What do you mean he's incredible?

1003
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,200
No. Alright, wait.

1004
01:10:53,224 --> 01:10:54,616
Stay there. I'm gonna come over.

1005
01:10:55,924 --> 01:10:57,138
No, I'm gonna come o...

1006
01:10:57,926 --> 01:10:58,998
Alright. Fine.

1007
01:10:59,022 --> 01:11:01,006
Fine, will you call me in the morning,
and, and...

1008
01:11:01,554 --> 01:11:03,170
we'll go and have breakfast and...

1009
01:11:04,269 --> 01:11:05,936
I wanna buy you something.

1010
01:11:07,268 --> 01:11:09,298
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

1011
01:11:11,523 --> 01:11:12,523
Ok.

1012
01:11:12,774 --> 01:11:13,774
And...

1013
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,297
what do you mean, incredible?

1014
01:11:18,029 --> 01:11:19,018
Alright. I'm sorry.

1015
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:20,042
Sleep tight.

1016
01:11:20,573 --> 01:11:21,877
Don't let the bedbugs...

1017
01:11:28,081 --> 01:11:29,278
She's alright.
She's...

1018
01:11:29,302 --> 01:11:30,823
just a little rattled.

1019
01:11:32,486 --> 01:11:35,283
Look Pete, I should have
told you about us.

1020
01:11:37,757 --> 01:11:39,540
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

1021
01:11:40,552 --> 01:11:42,334
It's just you know,
you never made a move.

1022
01:11:44,681 --> 01:11:45,681
You're right.

1023
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,100
I didn't.

1024
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:54,240
I'm gonna get some rest.

1025
01:11:56,276 --> 01:11:57,990
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

1026
01:11:59,612 --> 01:12:00,834
What was that thing?

1027
01:12:01,948 --> 01:12:02,948
I don't know.

1028
01:12:04,701 --> 01:12:06,864
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

1029
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:25,134
Somebody there?

1030
01:12:25,889 --> 01:12:27,524
Somebody?

1031
01:12:29,267 --> 01:12:30,313
Who said that?

1032
01:12:31,478 --> 01:12:34,164
Don't play the innocent with me.

1033
01:12:37,275 --> 01:12:39,320
You've known all along.

1034
01:12:43,948 --> 01:12:45,080
Where are you?

1035
01:12:45,492 --> 01:12:49,166
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.

1036
01:12:56,419 --> 01:12:57,431
I'm right here.

1037
01:13:00,006 --> 01:13:01,196
I don't understand.

1038
01:13:03,009 --> 01:13:05,978
Did you think it was coincidence?

1039
01:13:06,429 --> 01:13:10,158
So many good things,
all happening for you.

1040
01:13:10,234 --> 01:13:11,756
All for you,

1041
01:13:12,189 --> 01:13:13,431
Norman.

1042
01:13:16,356 --> 01:13:17,356
What do you want?

1043
01:13:18,316 --> 01:13:20,228
To say what you won't.

1044
01:13:20,652 --> 01:13:22,754
To do what you can't.

1045
01:13:23,363 --> 01:13:24,769
To remove...

1046
01:13:25,058 --> 01:13:27,129
those in your way.

1047
01:13:31,913 --> 01:13:33,112
The board members.

1048
01:13:35,569 --> 01:13:36,569
You killed them.

1049
01:13:36,709 --> 01:13:38,108
We killed them.

1050
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:39,670
We?

1051
01:13:39,838 --> 01:13:40,877
Remember?

1052
01:13:41,548 --> 01:13:44,216
Your little accident in the laboratory.

1053
01:13:46,219 --> 01:13:47,845
The performance enhancers.

1054
01:13:48,012 --> 01:13:48,918
Bingo.

1055
01:13:48,942 --> 01:13:49,942
Me!

1056
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:52,625
Your greatest creation.

1057
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:56,850
Bringing you what you've always wanted.

1058
01:13:57,522 --> 01:14:00,522
Power, beyond your wildest dreams.

1059
01:14:00,547 --> 01:14:02,491
And it's only the beginning.

1060
01:14:04,571 --> 01:14:06,101
There's only one...

1061
01:14:07,016 --> 01:14:08,500
who can stop us.

1062
01:14:09,701 --> 01:14:12,602
Or imagine if he joined us.

1063
01:14:18,001 --> 01:14:19,031
Spider-Man.

1064
01:14:19,615 --> 01:14:21,086
And the Green Goblin.

1065
01:14:21,254 --> 01:14:22,743
The Green Goblin. You like that?

1066
01:14:22,767 --> 01:14:24,207
Made it up myself.
Mr. Jameson.

1067
01:14:24,522 --> 01:14:26,371
These weirdos all gotta have a name now.

1068
01:14:26,396 --> 01:14:27,746
Mr. Jameson, Spider-Ma...

1069
01:14:27,771 --> 01:14:28,771
Hoffman!
Yeah?

1070
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:32,837
Call the patent office,
copyright the name Green Goblin,

1071
01:14:32,861 --> 01:14:34,621
I want a quarter every
time somebody says it.

1072
01:14:34,684 --> 01:14:36,070
How about Green Meanie?

1073
01:14:36,892 --> 01:14:38,843
Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.

1074
01:14:38,867 --> 01:14:40,249
He was trying to save it. That's slander.

1075
01:14:40,273 --> 01:14:42,125
It is not. I resent that.

1076
01:14:42,609 --> 01:14:43,848
Slander is spoken.

1077
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:45,153
In print, it's libel.

1078
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:47,676
You don't trust anybody,
that's your problem.

1079
01:14:47,906 --> 01:14:49,106
I trust my barber.

1080
01:14:50,525 --> 01:14:52,151
What are you, his lawyer?
Get outta here.

1081
01:14:52,202 --> 01:14:54,328
Let him sue me,
get rich like a normal person.

1082
01:14:54,495 --> 01:14:55,775
That's what made this country...

1083
01:15:04,464 --> 01:15:05,494
Jameson,

1084
01:15:05,518 --> 01:15:07,075
you slime.

1085
01:15:07,589 --> 01:15:11,166
Who's the photographer
who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?

1086
01:15:11,304 --> 01:15:13,404
I don't know who he is.
His stuff comes in the mail.

1087
01:15:13,429 --> 01:15:15,224
You're lying!
I swear.

1088
01:15:15,336 --> 01:15:17,693
He's the one who can bring me to him.

1089
01:15:17,718 --> 01:15:18,966
I don't know who he is.

1090
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:20,624
You are useless.

1091
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,374
Set him down tough guy.

1092
01:15:23,191 --> 01:15:24,617
Speak of the devil!

1093
01:15:24,641 --> 01:15:26,932
Spider-Man, I knew you two
were in this together!

1094
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:27,593
I...

1095
01:15:27,812 --> 01:15:30,601
Hey kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute, will you?

1096
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:33,086
Sleep...

1097
01:15:47,715 --> 01:15:49,455
Wake up little spider.

1098
01:15:50,199 --> 01:15:51,199
Wake up.

1099
01:15:51,886 --> 01:15:52,886
No,

1100
01:15:53,221 --> 01:15:54,752
you're not dead...

1101
01:15:55,088 --> 01:15:56,088
yet.

1102
01:15:56,516 --> 01:15:58,486
Just paralyzed...

1103
01:15:58,851 --> 01:16:00,236
temporarily.

1104
01:16:01,813 --> 01:16:04,563
You're an amazing creature, Spider-Man.

1105
01:16:05,288 --> 01:16:07,861
You and I are not so different.

1106
01:16:08,415 --> 01:16:09,558
I'm not like you.

1107
01:16:10,484 --> 01:16:11,751
You're a murderer.

1108
01:16:12,031 --> 01:16:13,031
Well,

1109
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:14,571
to each his own.

1110
01:16:15,076 --> 01:16:16,607
I chose my path,

1111
01:16:16,631 --> 01:16:18,201
you chose the way of the hero.

1112
01:16:18,705 --> 01:16:21,111
And they found you amusing
for a while,

1113
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:23,021
the people of this city.

1114
01:16:23,543 --> 01:16:26,535
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

1115
01:16:27,005 --> 01:16:28,744
is to see a hero fail,

1116
01:16:28,768 --> 01:16:29,578
fall,

1117
01:16:29,602 --> 01:16:30,602
die trying.

1118
01:16:31,082 --> 01:16:33,457
In spite of everything you've done for
them,

1119
01:16:33,481 --> 01:16:35,124
eventually, they will hate you.

1120
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:36,430
Why bother?

1121
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:38,671
Because it's right.

1122
01:16:39,099 --> 01:16:40,834
Here's the real truth.

1123
01:16:41,894 --> 01:16:44,521
There are eight million
people in this city.

1124
01:16:45,232 --> 01:16:49,401
And those teeming masses
exist for the sole purpose

1125
01:16:49,763 --> 01:16:53,572
of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

1126
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:55,068
You, me,

1127
01:16:55,632 --> 01:16:57,031
we're exceptional.

1128
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:02,581
I could squash you
like a bug right now.

1129
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:04,697
But I'm offering you a choice.

1130
01:17:05,604 --> 01:17:06,601
Join me.

1131
01:17:06,627 --> 01:17:10,016
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

1132
01:17:10,423 --> 01:17:12,524
What we could create.

1133
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,392
Or we could destroy.

1134
01:17:16,049 --> 01:17:19,357
Because the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish

1135
01:17:19,381 --> 01:17:22,220
battle again and again and
again until we're both dead.

1136
01:17:22,793 --> 01:17:24,605
Is that what you want?

1137
01:17:26,981 --> 01:17:28,879
Think about it, hero.

1138
01:17:41,829 --> 01:17:44,403
In spite of everything
you've done for them,

1139
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:46,465
eventually they will hate you.

1140
01:17:56,302 --> 01:17:57,302
Hey!

1141
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:58,375
It's me again.

1142
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,165
Hey!

1143
01:17:59,347 --> 01:18:00,509
How was your audition?

1144
01:18:00,973 --> 01:18:02,004
How'd you know?

1145
01:18:02,028 --> 01:18:03,571
The hot line. Your mom

1146
01:18:04,143 --> 01:18:05,680
told my aunt, told me.

1147
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:07,981
So you just came by?

1148
01:18:08,106 --> 01:18:09,553
I was in the neighborhood.

1149
01:18:09,577 --> 01:18:11,262
Needed to see a friendly face.

1150
01:18:11,901 --> 01:18:15,612
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...

1151
01:18:16,739 --> 01:18:17,807
So how'd it go?

1152
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:22,532
They said I needed acting lessons.

1153
01:18:23,106 --> 01:18:25,333
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

1154
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:28,614
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.

1155
01:18:29,115 --> 01:18:31,158
The sky's the limit, up to $7

1156
01:18:31,713 --> 01:18:32,952
84 cents.

1157
01:18:33,756 --> 01:18:35,333
I'd like a cheeseburger.

1158
01:18:36,622 --> 01:18:38,707
But, I'm going out to dinner with Harry.

1159
01:18:40,179 --> 01:18:41,179
Come with us.

1160
01:18:41,764 --> 01:18:42,764
No, thanks.

1161
01:18:43,504 --> 01:18:44,680
How's it going with...

1162
01:18:46,436 --> 01:18:47,285
Never mind.

1163
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:48,882
That's none of my business.

1164
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:50,439
It's not?

1165
01:18:52,358 --> 01:18:53,577
Why so interested?

1166
01:18:54,694 --> 01:18:55,694
I'm not.

1167
01:18:56,446 --> 01:18:57,446
You're not?

1168
01:18:59,449 --> 01:19:00,938
Well, why would I be?

1169
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,100
I don't know.

1170
01:19:02,382 --> 01:19:03,639
Why would you be?

1171
01:19:06,122 --> 01:19:07,207
I, that's a...

1172
01:19:08,454 --> 01:19:09,637
I don't know.

1173
01:19:12,637 --> 01:19:14,082
Sorry you won't come with us.

1174
01:19:17,823 --> 01:19:19,082
I better run, tiger.

1175
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:29,265
Hey, check it out, man.

1176
01:19:30,505 --> 01:19:31,505
Come on, man.

1177
01:19:35,735 --> 01:19:37,679
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

1178
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:57,779
Get off me!

1179
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:32,452
Wait!

1180
01:20:37,964 --> 01:20:40,003
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

1181
01:20:40,508 --> 01:20:42,456
You have a knack for saving my life.

1182
01:20:43,096 --> 01:20:44,995
I think I have a superhero stalker.

1183
01:20:45,096 --> 01:20:46,775
I was in the neighborhood.

1184
01:20:48,849 --> 01:20:49,849
You are...

1185
01:20:50,132 --> 01:20:51,132
amazing.

1186
01:20:52,436 --> 01:20:53,872
Some people don't think so.

1187
01:20:56,232 --> 01:20:57,232
But you are.

1188
01:20:57,788 --> 01:20:59,234
Nice to have a fan.

1189
01:20:59,986 --> 01:21:01,953
Do I get to say thank you this time?

1190
01:21:04,073 --> 01:21:05,073
Wait.

1191
01:22:14,255 --> 01:22:16,216
I have to get in there! My baby's in there!

1192
01:22:16,241 --> 01:22:17,551
My baby's in there! Let me go!

1193
01:22:17,575 --> 01:22:19,176
I can't let you in there,
the roof's about to collapse!

1194
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,846
Please save my baby!
I can't let you in there,

1195
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:22,836
Somebody save my baby!
The roof's about to collapse!

1196
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,194
Look! Up there!

1197
01:22:30,868 --> 01:22:32,661
Save my baby, please!

1198
01:22:56,352 --> 01:22:57,352
No!

1199
01:23:05,236 --> 01:23:06,600
It's ok. Your baby's fine.

1200
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:08,290
My baby!

1201
01:23:10,282 --> 01:23:11,897
God bless you, Spider-Man.

1202
01:23:12,368 --> 01:23:13,321
Bless you.

1203
01:23:13,346 --> 01:23:15,161
There he's! Don't let him get away!

1204
01:23:15,371 --> 01:23:16,777
Hold it! Hold it right there!

1205
01:23:17,056 --> 01:23:18,689
You're under arrest. I'm taking you in.

1206
01:23:18,736 --> 01:23:20,885
My God, there's
somebody still up there!

1207
01:23:23,295 --> 01:23:24,295
I'm going.

1208
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:28,163
I'll be here when you get back.

1209
01:23:28,187 --> 01:23:29,634
Not coming back, chief.

1210
01:23:30,052 --> 01:23:31,177
Go! Go!

1211
01:23:40,104 --> 01:23:41,135
Where are you?

1212
01:23:43,822 --> 01:23:45,127
Where are you?

1213
01:23:50,823 --> 01:23:52,112
I'm gonna get you out of here!

1214
01:23:55,786 --> 01:23:56,786
It's ok.

1215
01:24:04,336 --> 01:24:06,532
You're pathetically predictable.

1216
01:24:07,174 --> 01:24:08,775
Like a moth to the flame.

1217
01:24:09,884 --> 01:24:12,343
What about my generous proposal?

1218
01:24:13,387 --> 01:24:14,543
Are you in

1219
01:24:14,567 --> 01:24:15,876
or are you out?

1220
01:24:16,432 --> 01:24:18,004
It's you who's out, Gobby.

1221
01:24:18,296 --> 01:24:19,296
Out of your mind.

1222
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:20,817
Wrong answer.

1223
01:24:22,772 --> 01:24:23,772
Great.

1224
01:25:02,937 --> 01:25:05,136
No one says no to me!

1225
01:25:13,072 --> 01:25:15,020
MJ, will you stop goofing around?

1226
01:25:15,044 --> 01:25:16,491
Harry, relax.

1227
01:25:19,204 --> 01:25:20,245
He's here.

1228
01:25:21,038 --> 01:25:22,038
Are you ready?

1229
01:25:22,389 --> 01:25:23,389
Yeah.

1230
01:25:24,109 --> 01:25:25,447
Aunt May.

1231
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:26,886
I'm sorry I'm late.

1232
01:25:27,253 --> 01:25:28,366
Work was murder.

1233
01:25:29,038 --> 01:25:30,523
I picked up a fruitcake.

1234
01:25:30,548 --> 01:25:31,722
Why thank you Mr. Osborn.

1235
01:25:31,747 --> 01:25:33,028
We're so glad you could come.
You look great.

1236
01:25:33,052 --> 01:25:34,052
Thanks.

1237
01:25:34,218 --> 01:25:36,169
Who is this lovely young lady?

1238
01:25:37,096 --> 01:25:39,294
MJ, I'd like you to meet
my father, Norman Osborn.

1239
01:25:39,318 --> 01:25:41,021
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

1240
01:25:41,046 --> 01:25:42,380
Hi.
How do you do?

1241
01:25:42,404 --> 01:25:44,325
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

1242
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:45,842
Happy Thanksgiving, sir.

1243
01:25:45,866 --> 01:25:48,189
Now, where is Peter?

1244
01:25:48,568 --> 01:25:50,776
He'd better have remembered
that cranberry sauce.

1245
01:25:56,453 --> 01:25:57,229
That's...

1246
01:25:57,422 --> 01:25:58,883
weird, I didn't know he was here.

1247
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,080
Peter?

1248
01:26:09,314 --> 01:26:10,314
Peter?

1249
01:26:12,631 --> 01:26:13,719
Is that you?

1250
01:26:17,774 --> 01:26:18,774
Pete?

1251
01:26:19,805 --> 01:26:21,169
How strange.

1252
01:26:21,194 --> 01:26:22,625
There's nobody here.

1253
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:31,930
Bit of a slob, isn't he?

1254
01:26:32,016 --> 01:26:34,148
All brilliant men are.

1255
01:27:07,659 --> 01:27:08,675
Hey, everyone.

1256
01:27:09,386 --> 01:27:10,177
Peter!

1257
01:27:10,202 --> 01:27:12,150
Peter!
Sorry I'm late, it's a jungle out there.

1258
01:27:12,175 --> 01:27:14,841
Had to beat an old lady with
a stick to get these cranberries.

1259
01:27:16,612 --> 01:27:17,642
Thank you.

1260
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:19,447
Now then, everybody sit down

1261
01:27:19,685 --> 01:27:21,269
and we can say grace.

1262
01:27:22,675 --> 01:27:23,675
Parker.

1263
01:27:24,745 --> 01:27:26,496
Here we go.

1264
01:27:33,462 --> 01:27:34,576
There we are.

1265
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,165
It looks delicious.

1266
01:27:36,298 --> 01:27:37,298
Norman.

1267
01:27:39,593 --> 01:27:41,016
Will you do the honors?

1268
01:27:53,565 --> 01:27:54,846
Why Peter,

1269
01:27:54,955 --> 01:27:56,546
you're bleeding.

1270
01:27:59,538 --> 01:28:00,538
Yeah.

1271
01:28:00,759 --> 01:28:02,645
I stepped off a kerb and...

1272
01:28:03,087 --> 01:28:04,993
got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

1273
01:28:05,129 --> 01:28:06,540
Well, let me see.

1274
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,496
Oh my goodness.

1275
01:28:08,664 --> 01:28:10,982
That looks awful.
No, it's nothing.

1276
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:12,864
I'll get the first-aid kit.

1277
01:28:12,958 --> 01:28:14,561
Then we'll say grace.

1278
01:28:14,586 --> 01:28:17,369
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
in this apartment

1279
01:28:17,393 --> 01:28:19,918
and we
are going to do things properly.

1280
01:28:20,843 --> 01:28:22,881
How did you say that happened?

1281
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:25,439
Bike messenger.

1282
01:28:26,265 --> 01:28:27,478
Knocked me down.

1283
01:28:33,605 --> 01:28:35,303
If you'll excuse me I've...

1284
01:28:35,506 --> 01:28:37,355
got to be going.
Wh... Why?

1285
01:28:38,193 --> 01:28:39,307
Something...

1286
01:28:39,708 --> 01:28:41,419
has come to my attention.

1287
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:42,780
Are you alright?

1288
01:28:43,161 --> 01:28:44,646
I'm fine, just fine.

1289
01:28:44,670 --> 01:28:47,005
Thank you, Mrs. Parker.
Everyone.

1290
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:48,441
Enjoy the fruitcake.

1291
01:28:48,621 --> 01:28:49,621
Dad!

1292
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:52,076
Dad!

1293
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:53,193
What are you doing?

1294
01:28:53,474 --> 01:28:56,013
I plan this whole thing so you can
meet MJ and now you have to leave?

1295
01:28:56,037 --> 01:28:57,044
I've got to go.

1296
01:28:58,085 --> 01:28:59,577
This girl is important to me.

1297
01:28:59,601 --> 01:29:01,998
Harry, please. Look at her.

1298
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:06,225
Do you think a woman like that's sniffing
around because she likes your personality?

1299
01:29:06,472 --> 01:29:07,472
What are you saying?

1300
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:09,512
Your mother was beautiful too.

1301
01:29:09,537 --> 01:29:10,704
They're all beautiful.

1302
01:29:10,976 --> 01:29:15,063
Until they're snarling after your trust
fund like a pack of ravening wolves.

1303
01:29:15,272 --> 01:29:16,564
You're wrong about her, Dad.

1304
01:29:17,066 --> 01:29:20,234
A word to the not-so-wise
about your little girlfriend.

1305
01:29:20,444 --> 01:29:23,112
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

1306
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:36,515
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

1307
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:38,461
You heard?

1308
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,232
Everyone heard that creep.

1309
01:29:40,318 --> 01:29:42,036
That creep is my father.

1310
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:44,481
Alright, If I'm lucky, I'll
become half of what he is.

1311
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,200
So just keep your mouth shut
about stuff you don't understand!

1312
01:29:47,225 --> 01:29:49,114
Harry Osborn!

1313
01:29:49,764 --> 01:29:51,045
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

1314
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:58,192
Spider-Man is all but invincible.

1315
01:29:58,524 --> 01:29:59,762
But Parker,

1316
01:30:00,435 --> 01:30:02,014
we can destroy him.

1317
01:30:02,301 --> 01:30:03,301
I can't.

1318
01:30:03,362 --> 01:30:06,190
Betrayal must not be countenanced.

1319
01:30:06,615 --> 01:30:07,395
Parker...

1320
01:30:07,419 --> 01:30:08,866
must be educated.

1321
01:30:11,674 --> 01:30:12,513
What do I do?

1322
01:30:12,538 --> 01:30:16,345
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.

1323
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:18,031
Make him suffer.

1324
01:30:18,126 --> 01:30:20,118
Make him wish he were dead.

1325
01:30:20,525 --> 01:30:21,379
Yes?

1326
01:30:21,547 --> 01:30:23,464
And then grant his wish.

1327
01:30:24,704 --> 01:30:25,704
But how?

1328
01:30:25,884 --> 01:30:30,179
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.

1329
01:30:30,389 --> 01:30:31,556
Tell me how!

1330
01:30:31,723 --> 01:30:33,891
The heart, Osborn.

1331
01:30:34,143 --> 01:30:37,186
First, we attack his heart.

1332
01:30:39,064 --> 01:30:42,674
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses

1333
01:30:42,947 --> 01:30:45,760
as we forgive those who
trespassed against us.

1334
01:30:46,029 --> 01:30:49,057
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

1335
01:30:57,754 --> 01:31:00,297
Deliver us!

1336
01:31:00,483 --> 01:31:01,668
Finish it!

1337
01:31:02,004 --> 01:31:03,034
Finish it!

1338
01:31:03,059 --> 01:31:05,434
From evil!

1339
01:31:15,601 --> 01:31:16,851
Get the BP.

1340
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:18,190
Aunt May!

1341
01:31:18,354 --> 01:31:19,425
Is she gonna be ok?

1342
01:31:19,449 --> 01:31:21,290
What happened? What happened?
Yes, she's going to be ok.

1343
01:31:21,314 --> 01:31:22,361
Look, you're going to have to leave.

1344
01:31:22,385 --> 01:31:23,263
Right now.
What happened?

1345
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:24,552
Those eyes!

1346
01:31:24,632 --> 01:31:27,095
Those horrible yellow eyes!

1347
01:31:33,368 --> 01:31:34,727
He knows who I am.

1348
01:32:19,873 --> 01:32:20,873
I'm sorry.

1349
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:26,349
Will she be ok?

1350
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:27,716
She's gonna be fine.

1351
01:32:27,741 --> 01:32:29,396
She's been sleeping all day.

1352
01:32:31,468 --> 01:32:32,540
Thanks for coming.

1353
01:32:33,134 --> 01:32:34,163
Of course.

1354
01:32:38,392 --> 01:32:39,392
How are you?

1355
01:32:39,686 --> 01:32:41,427
You ok about the other night?

1356
01:32:41,452 --> 01:32:42,452
Yeah, I'm fine. I...

1357
01:32:43,170 --> 01:32:45,121
I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

1358
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:46,512
Have you talked to Harry?

1359
01:32:46,865 --> 01:32:47,865
He called me.

1360
01:32:49,006 --> 01:32:50,361
I haven't called him back.

1361
01:32:53,073 --> 01:32:54,200
The fact is...

1362
01:32:56,341 --> 01:32:57,774
I'm in love with somebody else.

1363
01:32:58,091 --> 01:32:58,786
You are?

1364
01:32:58,891 --> 01:33:00,184
At least, I think I am.

1365
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:04,848
It's not the right time to talk about it.
No, no.

1366
01:33:04,873 --> 01:33:05,873
Go on.

1367
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:08,270
Would I know his name, this guy?

1368
01:33:09,809 --> 01:33:11,863
You'll think I'm a stupid
little girl with a crush.

1369
01:33:12,551 --> 01:33:13,574
Trust me.

1370
01:33:14,177 --> 01:33:15,254
It's funny.

1371
01:33:17,431 --> 01:33:19,295
He's saved my life twice,

1372
01:33:19,319 --> 01:33:21,054
and I've never even seen his face.

1373
01:33:22,281 --> 01:33:23,281
Him.

1374
01:33:23,828 --> 01:33:24,938
You're laughing at me.
No. No.

1375
01:33:24,962 --> 01:33:26,302
No, I understand.

1376
01:33:26,812 --> 01:33:28,249
He is extremely cool.

1377
01:33:28,274 --> 01:33:31,195
But do you think it's true, all the
terrible things they say about him?

1378
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:32,183
No, no.

1379
01:33:32,207 --> 01:33:35,140
Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

1380
01:33:35,907 --> 01:33:37,131
I know him a little bit.

1381
01:33:37,743 --> 01:33:40,139
I'm sort of his
unofficial photographer.

1382
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:42,402
Has he mentioned me?

1383
01:33:43,188 --> 01:33:44,188
Yeah.

1384
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:45,372
What'd he say?

1385
01:33:46,405 --> 01:33:47,405
I said...

1386
01:33:48,754 --> 01:33:50,283
He asked me...

1387
01:33:51,332 --> 01:33:52,660
what I thought about you.

1388
01:33:54,293 --> 01:33:55,441
And what did you say?

1389
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:57,720
I said...

1390
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:02,171
Spider-Man. I said...

1391
01:34:03,575 --> 01:34:05,559
The great thing about MJ...

1392
01:34:06,385 --> 01:34:07,385
Is...

1393
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:09,690
When you...

1394
01:34:10,062 --> 01:34:11,346
look in her eyes,

1395
01:34:14,488 --> 01:34:16,416
and she's looking back in yours,

1396
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:19,856
everything...

1397
01:34:20,325 --> 01:34:21,325
feels...

1398
01:34:22,913 --> 01:34:24,246
Not quite normal.

1399
01:34:25,999 --> 01:34:27,217
Because you feel...

1400
01:34:28,335 --> 01:34:29,467
stronger...

1401
01:34:31,505 --> 01:34:32,535
and weaker...

1402
01:34:33,264 --> 01:34:34,576
at the same time.

1403
01:34:36,199 --> 01:34:37,631
You feel excited...

1404
01:34:39,296 --> 01:34:40,701
and at the same time...

1405
01:34:41,848 --> 01:34:42,958
Terrified.

1406
01:34:45,811 --> 01:34:47,383
The truth is you...

1407
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:49,934
you don't know what you feel,

1408
01:34:51,525 --> 01:34:54,122
except you know what
kind of man you want to be.

1409
01:34:57,864 --> 01:34:59,294
It's as if you've...

1410
01:35:00,367 --> 01:35:01,367
reached...

1411
01:35:01,723 --> 01:35:03,137
the unreachable...

1412
01:35:05,122 --> 01:35:06,746
and you weren't ready for it.

1413
01:35:11,294 --> 01:35:12,465
You said that?

1414
01:35:13,839 --> 01:35:15,708
Well, something like that.

1415
01:35:46,339 --> 01:35:47,339
Hey.

1416
01:36:00,469 --> 01:36:01,469
Dad?

1417
01:36:07,309 --> 01:36:08,765
Dad, is that you?

1418
01:36:15,984 --> 01:36:16,984
What is it?

1419
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:21,310
Well, you were right about MJ.

1420
01:36:22,175 --> 01:36:23,667
You're right about everything.

1421
01:36:25,884 --> 01:36:27,261
She's in love with Peter.

1422
01:36:28,747 --> 01:36:29,747
Parker?

1423
01:36:30,168 --> 01:36:30,609
Yeah.

1424
01:36:30,879 --> 01:36:32,512
And how does he feel about her?

1425
01:36:35,253 --> 01:36:37,456
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1426
01:36:38,757 --> 01:36:40,413
He pretends like he doesn't, but...

1427
01:36:40,811 --> 01:36:42,654
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1428
01:36:46,932 --> 01:36:48,022
I'm so sorry.

1429
01:36:51,144 --> 01:36:53,330
I haven't always been
there for you, have I?

1430
01:36:56,358 --> 01:36:58,723
You're busy.
You're an important man. I...

1431
01:36:58,747 --> 01:36:59,747
I understand.

1432
01:36:59,778 --> 01:37:01,217
That's no excuse.

1433
01:37:02,493 --> 01:37:03,865
I'm proud of you.

1434
01:37:04,908 --> 01:37:08,418
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'm gonna make it up to you, Harry.

1435
01:37:09,955 --> 01:37:13,348
I'm going to rectify certain inequities.

1436
01:37:27,347 --> 01:37:29,027
Wake up, little spider.

1437
01:37:29,236 --> 01:37:30,277
Wake up.

1438
01:37:32,143 --> 01:37:33,519
Go home, dear.

1439
01:37:33,851 --> 01:37:35,185
You look awful.

1440
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,773
And you look beautiful.
Well, thank you.

1441
01:37:37,983 --> 01:37:39,358
I don't like to leave you here.

1442
01:37:39,383 --> 01:37:40,858
But I'm safe here.

1443
01:37:41,444 --> 01:37:42,808
Can I do anything for you?

1444
01:37:42,832 --> 01:37:44,154
You do too much.

1445
01:37:44,322 --> 01:37:45,478
College, a job,

1446
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:48,530
all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1447
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:52,343
A smile. Finally.

1448
01:37:52,398 --> 01:37:55,741
Haven't seen one of those on your
face since Mary Jane was here.

1449
01:37:55,810 --> 01:37:56,810
Hey.

1450
01:37:56,861 --> 01:37:58,872
You were supposed to be asleep.

1451
01:38:00,028 --> 01:38:04,379
You know, you were about 6 years old
when MJ's family moved in next door.

1452
01:38:05,135 --> 01:38:06,707
And when she got out of the car,

1453
01:38:06,861 --> 01:38:09,096
and you saw her for the first time,

1454
01:38:09,264 --> 01:38:11,879
you grabbed me and said,
Aunt May,

1455
01:38:11,903 --> 01:38:13,089
Aunt May,

1456
01:38:13,759 --> 01:38:15,415
is that an angel?

1457
01:38:15,812 --> 01:38:17,009
Gee, did I say that?

1458
01:38:17,454 --> 01:38:18,884
You sure did.

1459
01:38:21,988 --> 01:38:22,442
Well,

1460
01:38:22,946 --> 01:38:24,259
Harry's in love with her.

1461
01:38:24,988 --> 01:38:26,394
She's still his girl.

1462
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:28,511
Well, isn't that up to her?

1463
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:30,856
She doesn't really know who I am.

1464
01:38:31,495 --> 01:38:33,167
Because you won't let her.

1465
01:38:33,747 --> 01:38:36,175
You're so mysterious all the time.

1466
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:38,125
Tell me,

1467
01:38:38,331 --> 01:38:40,025
would it be so dangerous

1468
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:43,316
to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1469
01:38:44,466 --> 01:38:46,967
Everybody else knows.

1470
01:38:50,013 --> 01:38:51,263
I'll be right back.

1471
01:38:51,931 --> 01:38:52,931
But...

1472
01:39:00,565 --> 01:39:02,003
Come on, pick up.

1473
01:39:02,617 --> 01:39:03,617
Hi...
Hey MJ!

1474
01:39:03,642 --> 01:39:04,992
Sing your song at the beep.

1475
01:39:07,072 --> 01:39:08,516
MJ, it's Peter. You there?

1476
01:39:09,258 --> 01:39:10,258
Hello?

1477
01:39:10,516 --> 01:39:11,516
You there?

1478
01:39:12,744 --> 01:39:14,628
Well, I'm just calling
to check up on you.

1479
01:39:14,652 --> 01:39:16,398
Will you call me when you get in, ok?

1480
01:39:17,297 --> 01:39:18,297
Alright, well...

1481
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Don't...

1482
01:39:20,992 --> 01:39:22,530
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1483
01:39:23,505 --> 01:39:24,505
Hello?

1484
01:39:27,786 --> 01:39:30,426
Can Spider-Man come out to play?

1485
01:39:31,346 --> 01:39:32,549
Where is she?

1486
01:40:19,484 --> 01:40:21,151
What is that?
That's cool!

1487
01:40:47,005 --> 01:40:48,714
Goblin, what have you done?

1488
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:32,079
Spider-Man!

1489
01:41:32,306 --> 01:41:35,150
This is why only fools are heroes.

1490
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:37,180
Because you never know,

1491
01:41:37,263 --> 01:41:41,360
when some lunatic will come
along with a sadistic choice.

1492
01:41:43,144 --> 01:41:45,633
Let die the woman you love?

1493
01:41:50,109 --> 01:41:51,109
Or...

1494
01:41:52,277 --> 01:41:54,859
Suffer the little children.

1495
01:41:57,465 --> 01:41:58,272
Spider-Man!

1496
01:41:58,296 --> 01:41:59,543
Save us!

1497
01:42:00,578 --> 01:42:02,075
Save us!

1498
01:42:03,081 --> 01:42:05,666
Make your choice, Spider-Man.

1499
01:42:05,875 --> 01:42:09,136
And see how a hero is rewarded.

1500
01:42:09,349 --> 01:42:10,605
Don't do it, Goblin!

1501
01:42:11,673 --> 01:42:14,068
We are who we choose to be.

1502
01:42:14,609 --> 01:42:15,944
Now, choose!

1503
01:42:15,969 --> 01:42:17,023
No!

1504
01:42:46,291 --> 01:42:47,655
Everybody stay still!

1505
01:42:57,385 --> 01:42:58,553
Ahoy up there!

1506
01:42:58,957 --> 01:43:01,875
We're gonna bring
the barge right under you.

1507
01:43:09,532 --> 01:43:10,532
He's coming back!

1508
01:43:10,907 --> 01:43:11,907
Listen.

1509
01:43:12,094 --> 01:43:13,442
I need you to climb down.

1510
01:43:13,467 --> 01:43:14,306
I can't.

1511
01:43:14,330 --> 01:43:15,330
Yes, you can!

1512
01:43:20,199 --> 01:43:21,730
MJ, you can do it.

1513
01:43:21,933 --> 01:43:22,933
You have to!

1514
01:43:23,293 --> 01:43:24,293
Trust me.

1515
01:43:26,497 --> 01:43:27,611
Hold on tight

1516
01:43:28,215 --> 01:43:29,215
and go quickly.

1517
01:43:34,672 --> 01:43:35,672
Hurry!

1518
01:43:35,929 --> 01:43:37,024
I can't. I can't do it!

1519
01:43:37,049 --> 01:43:38,422
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1520
01:44:07,038 --> 01:44:09,186
He's not gonna make it.
He's gonna make it!

1521
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:21,411
It's time to die.

1522
01:44:29,769 --> 01:44:32,587
Come on up here, tough guy!
I got a little something for ya!

1523
01:44:32,612 --> 01:44:33,860
We ought to kick your freaking ass!

1524
01:44:33,884 --> 01:44:35,095
Leave Spider-Man alone!

1525
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:37,279
You gonna pick on a guy trying
to save a bunch of kids?

1526
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:39,605
Yeah, I got something for your ass!

1527
01:44:39,630 --> 01:44:41,506
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1528
01:44:41,531 --> 01:44:43,991
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1529
01:44:57,588 --> 01:44:59,038
Spider-Man, watch out!

1530
01:45:31,247 --> 01:45:33,576
Misery, misery, misery.

1531
01:45:33,601 --> 01:45:35,209
That's what you've chosen.

1532
01:45:36,419 --> 01:45:38,224
I offered you friendship,

1533
01:45:39,111 --> 01:45:40,987
and you spat in my face.

1534
01:46:32,183 --> 01:46:35,308
You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.

1535
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:39,665
Had you not been so selfish,
your little girlfriend's death

1536
01:46:39,690 --> 01:46:41,233
would have been quick and painless.

1537
01:46:41,258 --> 01:46:44,275
But now that
you've really pissed me off,

1538
01:46:45,029 --> 01:46:46,768
I'm gonna finish her,

1539
01:46:47,221 --> 01:46:50,091
nice and slow.

1540
01:46:54,497 --> 01:46:56,074
MJ and I...

1541
01:46:57,375 --> 01:47:00,473
We're gonna have a hell of a time.

1542
01:47:54,386 --> 01:47:55,676
Peter, stop!

1543
01:47:56,184 --> 01:47:57,184
Stop!

1544
01:47:57,226 --> 01:47:58,324
It's me.

1545
01:48:07,612 --> 01:48:08,784
Mr. Osborn.

1546
01:48:09,136 --> 01:48:10,558
Peter, thank God for you.

1547
01:48:11,355 --> 01:48:13,325
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1548
01:48:13,417 --> 01:48:15,800
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

1549
01:48:16,175 --> 01:48:18,284
Don't, don't let him take me again.

1550
01:48:18,664 --> 01:48:20,707
I beg you. Protect me.

1551
01:48:20,875 --> 01:48:23,017
You tried to kill Aunt May.

1552
01:48:23,042 --> 01:48:24,419
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1553
01:48:24,629 --> 01:48:25,676
But not you.

1554
01:48:26,797 --> 01:48:28,328
I tried to stop it,

1555
01:48:28,793 --> 01:48:30,567
but I couldn't stop it.

1556
01:48:30,968 --> 01:48:32,457
I would never hurt you.

1557
01:48:33,262 --> 01:48:34,699
I knew from the beginning...

1558
01:48:35,389 --> 01:48:37,613
If anything ever happened to me...

1559
01:48:37,983 --> 01:48:40,293
It was you that I could count on.

1560
01:48:40,811 --> 01:48:44,147
You, Peter Parker,
would save me and so you have.

1561
01:48:44,732 --> 01:48:45,979
Thank God for you.

1562
01:48:47,568 --> 01:48:48,745
Give me your hand.

1563
01:48:50,154 --> 01:48:51,226
Believe in me...

1564
01:48:51,609 --> 01:48:53,232
as I believed in you.

1565
01:48:54,694 --> 01:48:56,536
I've been like a father to you.

1566
01:48:59,330 --> 01:49:00,997
Be a son to me now.

1567
01:49:02,792 --> 01:49:04,113
I have a father.

1568
01:49:05,419 --> 01:49:07,379
His name was Ben Parker.

1569
01:49:09,799 --> 01:49:11,799
Godspeed Spider-Man.
What?

1570
01:49:30,194 --> 01:49:31,194
Peter...

1571
01:49:34,031 --> 01:49:35,323
Don't tell Harry.

1572
01:50:07,565 --> 01:50:08,670
What have you done?

1573
01:50:09,442 --> 01:50:10,619
What have you done?

1574
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:35,300
Hey.

1575
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:40,507
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1576
01:50:42,141 --> 01:50:44,093
I know what it's like to lose a father.

1577
01:50:47,438 --> 01:50:48,635
I didn't lose him.

1578
01:50:48,659 --> 01:50:50,148
He was stolen from me.

1579
01:50:52,318 --> 01:50:53,968
One day, Spider-Man will pay.

1580
01:50:56,489 --> 01:50:58,897
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

1581
01:51:04,622 --> 01:51:06,171
Thank God for you, Peter.

1582
01:51:07,166 --> 01:51:08,687
You're the only family I have.

1583
01:51:34,041 --> 01:51:35,538
No matter what I do,

1584
01:51:36,479 --> 01:51:38,396
no matter how hard I try,

1585
01:51:40,214 --> 01:51:41,562
the ones I love

1586
01:51:42,248 --> 01:51:44,217
will always be the ones who pay.

1587
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,771
You must miss him so much.

1588
01:51:58,175 --> 01:52:00,208
It's been so hard without him.

1589
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:06,193
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1590
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:10,069
When I was up there,

1591
01:52:11,425 --> 01:52:12,945
and I thought I was gonna die...

1592
01:52:15,776 --> 01:52:18,218
There was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1593
01:52:20,906 --> 01:52:23,179
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1594
01:52:25,522 --> 01:52:26,897
It was you Pete.

1595
01:52:28,873 --> 01:52:30,139
I kept thinking,

1596
01:52:31,417 --> 01:52:33,374
I hope I make it through this,

1597
01:52:35,421 --> 01:52:38,555
so I could see Peter Parker's
face one more time.

1598
01:52:41,177 --> 01:52:42,177
Really?

1599
01:52:43,053 --> 01:52:44,584
There's only one man,

1600
01:52:45,576 --> 01:52:47,685
who's always been there for me...

1601
01:52:50,102 --> 01:52:51,584
Who makes me feel...

1602
01:52:52,521 --> 01:52:54,981
like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1603
01:52:58,360 --> 01:52:59,552
That I'm just...

1604
01:53:00,696 --> 01:53:01,696
Me.

1605
01:53:03,282 --> 01:53:04,383
And that's ok.

1606
01:53:07,166 --> 01:53:08,166
The truth is,

1607
01:53:10,998 --> 01:53:11,998
I love you.

1608
01:53:14,877 --> 01:53:16,476
I love you so much, Peter.

1609
01:53:37,525 --> 01:53:38,721
All I wanted,

1610
01:53:39,009 --> 01:53:41,298
was to tell
her how much I loved her...

1611
01:53:42,488 --> 01:53:43,488
I can't.

1612
01:53:46,534 --> 01:53:47,601
You can't what?

1613
01:53:49,203 --> 01:53:50,249
Tell you...

1614
01:53:52,373 --> 01:53:53,903
Everything. I mean...

1615
01:53:54,952 --> 01:53:56,626
there's so much to tell.

1616
01:53:57,795 --> 01:53:58,795
Yeah.

1617
01:53:59,656 --> 01:54:01,390
There's so much to tell.

1618
01:54:02,523 --> 01:54:03,866
I want you to know...

1619
01:54:05,010 --> 01:54:07,389
that I will always be there for you.

1620
01:54:08,044 --> 01:54:10,827
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1621
01:54:12,851 --> 01:54:14,319
I promise you that.

1622
01:54:18,148 --> 01:54:20,045
I will always be your friend.

1623
01:54:23,362 --> 01:54:24,678
Only a friend...

1624
01:54:26,115 --> 01:54:27,201
Peter Parker?

1625
01:54:29,827 --> 01:54:31,568
That's all I have to give.

1626
01:54:59,023 --> 01:55:01,265
Whatever life holds in store for me,

1627
01:55:02,022 --> 01:55:04,297
I will never forget these words.

1628
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:06,476
With great power,

1629
01:55:06,905 --> 01:55:08,882
comes great responsibility.

1630
01:55:10,159 --> 01:55:11,476
This is my gift.

1631
01:55:12,578 --> 01:55:13,773
My curse.

1632
01:55:15,205 --> 01:55:16,205
Who am I?

1633
01:55:17,499 --> 01:55:18,875
I'm Spider-Man.

1634
01:55:47,576 --> 01:55:50,576
