There are multiple realities.

This is Earth Dimension 616.
I'm from Earth 833.

Sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse?

I thought that was theoretical.

499

That changes how we understand
the initial singularity.

500

They were born in stable orbits
within black holes.

507
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:09,045
Creatures formed
from the primary elements:

508
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,674
Air, water, fire, earth.

509
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:14,301
The Science Division had
a technical name.

510
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,474
We just called them Elementals.

511
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:18,973
Versions of them exist
across our mythologies.

512
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,726
Like Thor.

513
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:25,900
Thor was a myth,
now I study him in my physics class.

514
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:28,399
These myths are threats.

515
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:31,147
They first materialised
on my Earth many years ago.

516
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:32,481
We mobilised and fought them,

517
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:35,239
but with each battle,
they grew, got stronger.

518
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:38,287
I was part of the last battalion left
trying to stop them.

519
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,580
All we did was delay the inevitable.

520
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:43,956
The Elementals are here now,
attacking the same coordinates.

521
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:45,206
Our satellites confirm it.

Thank Mr. Beck for destroying
the other three.

There's only one left: Fire.

524
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:53,844
The strongest of them all.
The one that destroyed my Earth.

525
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,761
It's the one that took my family.

526
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:02,679
I'm sorry.

527
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,229
And it will be in Prague
in approximately 48 hours.

528
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:09,482
We have one mission: Kill it.
And you're coming with us.

529
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,360
I'm sorry, did you say Prague? Heh.

530

I know, but that was an accident.

534
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,166
There's got to be someone else
you can use.

535
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,131
- What about Thor?
- Off-world.

536
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:32,925
Okay, um, Doctor Strange.

537
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:34,547
- Unavailable.
- Captain Marvel.

538
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:36,049
Don't invoke her name.

539
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,095
Sir, look, I wanna help. I do.

540
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,766
But if my aunt finds out I left
my class trip, she'll kill me.

541
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:43,219
And if I'm seen in Europe
after the Washington Monument,

542
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:45,851
my class will figure out who I am, then...

543
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:48,502
Then the whole world will figure out
who I am, and then I'm done.

544
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,060
Okay.

545
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:52,565
I understand.

546
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,033
I'm sorry, what?

548

Why give it to you?

Maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH,
he just trusted me to pick who should.

968
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:25,055
It makes much more sense.
He knew I'd do what's right.

Hi. Yeah, um...

978

I'd like to transfer your control
over to Quentin Beck.

to make, okay? And I'm gonna make it.

01:06:17,683 --> 01:06:19,799
"Yes," like you wanna go?

1104
01:06:19,894 --> 01:06:21,054
Yes.

1105
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:24,933
Awesome. I'll see you outside
in 10 minutes.

1106
01:06:25,024 --> 01:06:26,855
Meet me outside in five minutes.

1107
01:06:27,985 --> 01:06:29,441
- Five is good.
- Okay.

1108
01:06:29,528 --> 01:06:31,314
- Okay, bye.
- Bye. Heh.

1109

(SPEAKING IN CZECH)

1110
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:37,901
Night Monkey, help us!
Help! Night Monkey!

1111
01:06:46,921 --> 01:06:47,831
PETER: Hey!
MJ: Hey!

1112
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:49,287
Where do you wanna go?

1113
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:51,121
- Who cares?
- Awesome.

1114
01:06:51,217 --> 01:06:52,216
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1115
01:06:59,058 --> 01:07:01,549
PETER: I'm glad we're doing this.
- Yeah, me too.

1116
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,805
They used to execute people
on this bridge.

1117
01:07:06,899 --> 01:07:10,812
They would put them in a basket,
and they would drown in the water.

1118
01:07:12,905 --> 01:07:14,861
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1119
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:21,777
There's this thing I've been wanting
to talk to you about

1120
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:23,783
for a while.

1121
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:26,709
Yeah?

1122
01:07:28,003 --> 01:07:29,618
It's our last night in Europe,

1123
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:33,706
and I had this plan
that I wanted to tell you.

1124
01:07:33,801 --> 01:07:35,337
I'm just gonna tell you.

1125
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,636
- MJ, I...
- "I'm Spider-Man."

1126
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:42,922
- What?
- That's what you were gonna say.

1127
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:44,053
That you're Spider-Man.

1128
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:48,521
No. I'm not Spider-Man.

1129
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:51,682
I've been watching you for a while now.

1130
01:07:51,777 --> 01:07:54,063
It's kind of obvious.

1131
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:56,281
I'm not Spider-Man.

1132
01:07:56,365 --> 01:07:58,777
What would make you think
that I was Spider-Man?

1133
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:00,903
- Peter, Washington?
- Yeah?

1134
01:08:00,995 --> 01:08:04,613
The fact that you disappear
out of nowhere for no reason.

1135
01:08:04,707 --> 01:08:07,664
No, I was sick. Remember?
I had my... The tummy?

1136
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:09,412
Susan Yang thinks you're a male escort.

1137
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:11,835
What? Of course I'm not a male escort.

1138
01:08:11,922 --> 01:08:14,914
- Then you're Spider-Man.
- I'm not Spider-Man at all.

1139
01:08:15,009 --> 01:08:18,342
What about tonight? You snuck off,
and you fought that thing. I saw you.

1140
01:08:18,429 --> 01:08:20,841
You can't have seen me
because I'm not Spider-Man.

1141
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:23,422
Also, on the news,
it was the Night Monkey.

1142
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:24,973
- The Night Monkey?
- Yeah.

1143
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,051
That's what it said on the news,

1144
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:29,477
and the news never lies.

1145
01:08:30,733 --> 01:08:33,645
- Night Monkey. Okay.
- What are you doing?

1146
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:38,987
Well, do the Night Monkey
and Spider-Man use the same webs?

1147
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,406
I mean, maybe.

1148
01:08:41,869 --> 01:08:44,076
Maybe he's a Spider Monkey.
Who knows?

1149
01:08:48,459 --> 01:08:51,075
Were you only watching me
because you thought I was Spider-Man?

1150
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:55,590
Yeah.

1151
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,756
Why else would I be watching you?

1152
01:09:00,846 --> 01:09:03,553
Doesn't matter. Just thought that maybe...

1153
01:09:09,688 --> 01:09:11,098
What the hell was that?

1154
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:13,980
I don't know.

1156
01:09:25,204 --> 01:09:27,741
What is it, some kind of projector
or something?

1157
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:31,118
Yeah, but it's really advanced.

1158
01:09:31,585 --> 01:09:33,496
It... It looked so real.

1159

- It...
- Yeah, really real.

- The Elementals are fake?

That doesn't make any sense
because we were there, right?

1162
01:09:43,681 --> 01:09:46,718
There was fire and destruction, and...

Who would do something like that?

I am Spider-Man.

01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:11,910
- And I've really messed up.
- Wait. You're being serious?

01:10:15,129 --> 01:10:16,039
No, I'm not joking.

1170

I was only like 67 percent sure.

MJ: So why are you here?

1172

- Why are you on this school trip?
- I know you have a lot of questions,

but we have to get out of here, okay?

Okay. Okay.
I can't believe I figured it out!

You took everything from me!

Sorry.

Yeah, can you just fast-forward
to the end?

Yep. Stand by.

It's something...

Double the damage and then run it again.

With her drones, we'll create an event
big enough to cover an entire city.

1200
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:58,224
All right, well done.

1201
01:11:58,315 --> 01:12:00,897
Make sure every drone is weapons-hot.
We need maximum damage.

1202
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:03,441
- That is gonna cause a lot of casualties.
BECK: Oh, yeah.

1203
01:12:03,529 --> 01:12:06,191
More casualties, more coverage.
I got to cut through the static.

1204
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:09,318
London is a beautiful city,
and it will suffer, but they can rebuild.

If I'm the next Iron Man,

Oh, one of the drones that came back
from the plaza was missing a projector.

Wait, and you're...?
You're telling me this now?

1216

It's... It's one drone.

1217
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:43,190
- The image will be perfect, I promise.
- That projector is evidence.

1218
01:12:43,277 --> 01:12:46,314
It's going to tell people what we're doing
and how we're doing it.

and most dangerous person on the planet.

1221
01:12:53,704 --> 01:12:56,912
If he catches on before I've killed him,
he will put a bullet in my head.

How could I be that stupid?

He's probably spying on me right now
or sending a drone to come and kill me.

Yeah, I didn't really want them,
