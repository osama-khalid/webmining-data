Weird place for your mind to go, but not unexpected. Almost like you recognize that what you did was wrong, so you're desperately trying to rationalize your objectively weird behavior. Go ask your friends what's weirder: seeing tits at a Hugh Hefner party or you looking up topless videos next to your kids.\n\nI do love this reaction, though. \n\n&gt;It is quite amazing how you can so confidently act as the judge of morality. \n\nWell morality is both individual and cultural. As an individual, I choose not to conflate events happening at a Hugh Hefner party to someone pulling out their dick at work. In the eyes of our justice system, the two events are very different. So yea, pretty confident. You know what, instead of your friends, go ask your parents and in-laws which is weirder.\n\n&gt;That is what always cracks me up about Reddit culture. You will jump on anyone that is deemed immoral or problematic \n&gt;\n\nI'm sure you can point to examples of me doing this, right? Ooo someone disagreed with me, they must be calling me problematic. You need to assume that I'm doing this so you can get out of actually engaging with my points. It's a cope out bordering on persecution complex.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, in the next breath\n\nSeeing as the comment about your children came last, this is quite impossible.\n\n&gt;you are comparing an entire room of clothed models to \u201cstrippers,\u201d \n\nNo idea what you even mean here. Strippers are not fully clothed and burlesque shows often feature, of not nudity, then at least sexual content.\n\n&gt;made up standards for the reasonable expectation of nudity (I\u2019m still unclear on the threshold for this one, please explain further, lol)\n&gt;\n\nWell I gave several examples. I also didn't make them up. They're literally different from a legal standpoint. But here's some more stuff you'll ignore:\n\nIf we go to a strip club, there's a reasonable expectation to see breasts. Those strippers aren't seen (other than by the puritanical) to be doing anything illegal or immoral. But if a guy pulls out his dick in the same strip club, it's can suddenly be seen as both. Why is that? Oh yea, because different environments have different standards of consent involving adults engaging in adult behavior.\n\nIf you attend an adult drag event, you're consenting to seeing racy material, some even bordering on pornographic. But if you attend a drag queen story hour, you're only consenting to having a book read. Shared element, but wildly different expectations.\n\n&gt;You keep referring to this as a \u201cPlayboy party,\u201d when it is very clearly a birthday party, and also had friends and family members in attendance. \n&gt;\n\nYes, the birthday party for a porn mogul. He typically has multiple parties, one of which is usually held as an invite only at a private suite like this. His family regularly attends his Playboy mansion parties. \n\nYou're just splitting hairs.\n\n&gt;You are jumping through all of these hoops \n\n\"All those hoops\" being explaining the difference between a professional environment and the private party of a man known for having orgies at his parties.\n\n&gt;Why is that? Why are you so determined to prove that one is ok, and the other is not? What is your underlying motivation?\n\nMy underlying motivation is to prevent weirdos like you from conflating systemic rape (curious as to what your motivation for that was) and genuine sexual harassment that easily constitutes a hostile work environment, to seeing a topless woman at the private, invite only party of a porn mogul. Why are you so dead set on downplaying hostile work environments?", "1674603241", "PatrickBearman", "/r/television/comments/10izc6g/pamela_anderson_alleges_tim_allen_flashed_his/j5r29rm/", "10izc6g"], ["television", "Stacey Abrams playing a significant world leader on Star Trek Discovery was a bit too on the nose.", "1674430319", "Stardustchaser", "/r/television/comments/10iag9r/in_your_opinion_what_is_one_of_the_weirdest_makes/j5h40an/", "10iag9r"], ["television", "I loved the series but it was possibly more reviled than the show was.", "1674344042", "Mrjoegangles", "/r/television/comments/10i4hiz/willow_ep_ron_howard_talks_season_two_renewal/j5cbaio/", "10i4hiz"], ["television", "That\u2019s not The Last of Us tho\u2026.", "1674343985", "The_Notorious_Donut", "/r/television/comments/10h6c22/i_dont_like_the_time_skip_in_the_last_of_us/j5cb5o7/", "10h6c22"], ["television", "What was the topic?", "1674257633", "OptimusPrimalRage", "/r/television/comments/10gd5vf/last_week_tonight_with_john_oliver_season_10/j57mt8a/", "10gd5vf"], ["television", "Who cares.
