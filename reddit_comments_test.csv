Isn't it a little silly to you that there are more rules, regulations, and licenses involved in the production of and operation of motorized vehicles, designed merely for transportation, than there are firearms designed purely for the purpose of killing?

I mean when I bought my gun, you know what I went through? I handed over my ID, filled out a form, waited 2 days for the background check, and came back and picked up the gun. That's it. No training, no coaching, no manual, no studying, nothing. Simply ""heres your gun."". They don't even verify that I have safe storage or kids.

In order to drive a car, I have to practice with a licensed instructor, take a written test, a driving test, maintain a valid driver's license every 8 years, pass an eye exam, keep proof of registration and insurance at all times, and adhere to strict road regulations. Violation of any of those sees my license confiscated and I can be arrested if I try to drive again without it.

politics,"Neither of those two ""eased into power"".

[Mussolini](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Benito-Mussolini/Rise-to-power):

&gt;Fascist squads, militias inspired by Mussolini but often created by local leaders, swept through the countryside of the Po Valley and the Puglian plains, rounded up Socialists, burned down union and party offices, and terrorized the local population. Hundreds of radicals were humiliated, beaten, or killed. In late 1920, the Blackshirt squads, often with the direct help of landowners, began to attack local government institutions and prevent left-wing administrations from taking power. Mussolini encouraged the squads‚Äîalthough he soon tried to control them‚Äîand organized similar raids in and around Milan. By late 1921, the Fascists controlled large parts of Italy, and the left, in part because of its failures during the postwar years, had all but collapsed. The government, dominated by middle-class Liberals, did little to combat this lawlessness, both through weak political will and a desire to see the mainly working-class left defeated. As the Fascist movement built a broad base of support around the powerful ideas of nationalism and anti-Bolshevism, Mussolini began planning to seize power at the national level.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the summer of 1922, Mussolini‚Äôs opportunity presented itself. The remnants of the trade-union movement called a general strike. Mussolini declared that unless the government prevented the strike, the Fascists would. Fascist volunteers, in fact, helped to defeat the strike and thus advanced the Fascist claim to power.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, all over Italy the Fascists prepared for action, and the March on Rome began. Although it was far less orderly than Fascist propaganda later suggested, it was sufficiently threatening to bring down the government. And the king, prepared to accept the Fascist alternative, dispatched the telegram for which Mussolini had been waiting.

[Hitler](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/hitler-comes-to-power):

&gt;Beginning in fall 1929, there was a world economic crisis known as the Great Depression. Millions of Germans lost their jobs. Unemployment, hunger, poverty, and homelessness became serious problems in Germany in the early 1930s.  
&gt;  
&gt;The German government failed to solve the problems caused by the Great Depression. Germany was politically divided. This made passing new laws almost impossible because of disagreements in the German parliament. Many Germans lost faith in their leaders‚Äô ability to govern.  
&gt;  
&gt;Radical political groups like the Nazi Party and the Communist Party became more prominent. They took advantage of the economic and political chaos. They used propaganda to attract Germans who were fed up with the political stalemate.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The Nazis played on people‚Äôs hopes, fears, and prejudices. They also offered scapegoats. They falsely claimed that Jews and Communists were to blame for Germany‚Äôs problems. This claim was part of the Nazis‚Äô antisemitic and racist ideology.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;In January 1933, Hitler did not immediately become a dictator. When he became chancellor, Germany‚Äôs democratic constitution was still in effect. However, Hitler transformed Germany by manipulating the democratic political system. Hitler and other Nazi leaders used existing laws to destroy German democracy and create a dictatorship.  
&gt;  
&gt;In August 1934, President Hindenburg died. Hitler proclaimed himself F√ºhrer (leader) of Germany. From that point forward, Hitler was the dictator of Germany.

Making dicks less taboo will only reduce that specific type of predatory sexual behaviour, but it won‚Äôt make an impact on the overall amount.

OK, that makes more sense.  You may well be right that predators will just substitute one behavior for another, but maybe not.  Intuitively, it seems like the fewer avenues predators have to victimize people, the better.  Showing your ding-ding to randos is pretty easy, so if predators had to substitute a behavior that involved significantly more time, effort, or risk, then I could see at least some of them not going to the trouble.

television,"Did not miss the point at all. The law is very clear: ""Offers made in jest are only invalid if the offeree knows or has reason to know that the offer is a joke."" \[*See* Restatement (Second) of Contracts\]. You stated yourself that Leonard was not actually arguing that he was confused about the commercial. In other words, he knew it was a joke. Ipso facto, it was not an actual offer. It's really that simple. 

Yes, of course Pepsi fucked up. I'm not arguing they didn't. They should have put a disclaimer in the ad just like the Canadian commercial. Had they done that they wouldn't have had to deal with the legal process and the negative publicity. But the fact remains that John and Todd, the middle-aged multi-millionaire financing the entire scheme (you seemed to have forgotten about him), were legally incorrect in their argument. I'm not like a fan of Pepsi or rooting for them or anything, but legally their argument was correct and it just is what it is.",1673048047,Beezus_Fuffoon18,/r/television/comments/z6by6a/pepsi_wheres_my_jet_netflix_docuseries_takes_what/j39itb6/,z6by6a
